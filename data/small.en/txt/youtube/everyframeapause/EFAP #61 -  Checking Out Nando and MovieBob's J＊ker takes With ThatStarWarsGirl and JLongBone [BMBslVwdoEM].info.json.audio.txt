Like make it a Dr.
Moreau type thing.
Maybe the doctor, the old guy goes nuts.
And then he's like, oh, I can.
I can make a park with the dinosaur human.
I can't wait for the third Jurassic World movie
where they still go with this idiotic premise
that using dinosaurs for the military is a good idea.
Oh, my God.
It's like you'd think after the first movie,
they would have got a clue, but they were like, no, no.
We have to make the dinosaurs into military people.
Oh, stupid.
Oh, my God, Jeff.
And oh, oh, my God, what's his name?
Vincent D'Onofrio playing that good old boy fat redneck fucker
trying to sell the shit like, oh, what, what do you say?
Struggle breeds greatness.
And yeah, we can put laser beams on dinosaurs.
And shit. Oh, my God.
I don't get the fear of this shit like he's so stupid.
The stupid second movie where the dude has the gun
with the laser pointer on it and he points it at a thing.
And it's like, why don't you just shoot the thing with the gun
instead of sending the velociraptor to kill the thing?
It's so stupid.
This is Jurassic Land and bullets magically are repelled by dinosaur skin.
I mean, they could have done it like put a chip inside the dinosaurs brain
and like give them orders.
Didn't it like die by getting impaled on like really ancient
30,000 year old bones?
What are we what are we talking about?
The death by the winner.
Dom, whatever the stupid name for the stupid like Carl Weird Raptor is
in the second Jurassic World, how it died.
Oh, yeah. Dom is in domino.
This abominable race in the raptor and the raptor.
That's what it was called.
Didn't it like they had to kill it by like throwing it down.
Which is what the French called Vietnam.
Oh, at the Battle of the Unbound Fool.
So it's going to be weird.
So it will be a sudden update.
Whenever that happens, everything gets fucked.
So like chat is not on screen because for no reason.
It's also no reason.
Dreaming the wrong.
Everything is wrong right now.
It's it's got the right title and description, but for some reason
it's got the wrong thumbnail.
I don't know how that happened.
I haven't seen you use that thumbnail in a long time, too.
But like I didn't upload.
I've not uploaded that thumbnail for like a million years.
So I don't know what the hell it's doing.
Is it on like the wrong profile?
Looks like it's on my profile.
But what is fixed?
You get the yeah, I've seen it on the recommended and the home page.
And it shows we're live.
Does it show the correct thumbnail?
Yes. OK, well, but I'm still it shows the screen that we're seeing right now.
Yeah, it shouldn't show that.
What is it doing?
It's fucking tisming.
Lying to me.
I'm curious to find out if something else has happened.
Oh, maybe it's streaming through the wrong thing, maybe.
OK, so it can't be that account.
It's not a Mueller account.
It's definitely more of some reason.
It doesn't want to listen to the hospital.
You can go through this stupid.
Right. Why would you make half a joke and then give up Rex?
Come on, because I think I think halfway through, I knew that was one.
I mean, sometimes it's best to go down with a ship.
Wait, so Shinobi said that the bones that the Indoraptor impaled itself on
weren't real bones.
They were stronger bones.
And that's why it was able to kill the Indoraptor.
So OK. OK.
Oh, OK. Yeah.
I mean, I'm not saying that your opinion doesn't matter
if you like the Jurassic World movies, but.
Oh, does he?
Is that one of his things?
Is that his?
Well, you were the one that watched it, weren't you?
Like the the puppet guy who screamed.
I remember the puppet guy.
I want to say that we didn't like make it through
almost the majority of it because something else happened
because I know like of his video, but I don't really remember his video.
If you're picking up when I'm laying down, I can't change the thumbnail.
It won't let me.
Like, I got shot on screen at least.
But are you subscribed to YouTube Red?
No. Does that have to do with anything?
Well, I don't know.
Maybe that's their new thing is that you have to be subscribed to YouTube Red.
I'm almost certain this is to do with OBS because it never before
is it asked me before I started streaming?
What would you like to title your stream?
It's like I've got the title.
I've subscribed to OBS Red.
Controversial.
There is no OBS Red.
I'll kill you.
Go to live.
Is it in the live control room now?
Is that what we're doing, YouTube?
Are you forcing me here?
The dead room.
It is.
Please tell me I'm not the only one who has to deal with this tism.
Well, I have a dream.
So I don't have to deal with it.
I haven't done a new stream since a while, so.
Oh, God, so many weird options.
They scare me.
I'm too old for this.
Excellent.
Where's the option to do a thumbnail?
Just give me the fucking option for a thumbnail.
I will hurt you.
Change thumbnail.
There we go.
YouTube, you musty bit.
Anybody who's listening to this is like, what happened?
I'm not doing a J.
OK, all my options have changed and it scares me.
OK, I'm not ready for this.
You should have figured that out beforehand.
I can't know this was going to happen until I hit stream.
This is episode like 90, 12.
Please clarify if your stream is made for kids.
Fuck off.
Oh, my. Oh, no.
Lot my big ass cock on the table.
Yeah. OK.
Get a look at that.
Run screaming.
I've already said no, Rags.
They cannot.
They're not allowed to watch those pesky children.
How dare they?
This is an this is an AO rated stream that that means adults only.
You know what?
You are below the age of twenty one.
Then you need to vacate the premise immediately or click the button
to confirm that you are over 21.
You guys know that like they're going to be nuking
classic studio by the end of this year.
Like it's just going to be gone entirely.
Classic studio.
And like the four analytics no longer work on classic.
You have to look them in the new version.
And I think what's happening is like phasing in a live stream
is no longer going to work for me on classic.
And I know how to do everything on classic.
Why are you taking it away from me?
What did I do?
We have to this is just like Disney and everyone.
You have to destroy the old things that you love and know
and that works and we're competent in order to prop up your new shitty things
that you want everyone to like.
Let the past die.
Even if it's kill it, even if it's much more superior
than your crappy new shit, new shit is terrible.
Did it hurt?
When I pen it.
Take me to the live control room.
OK, wait, is the is the thumbnail correct now or is it still being a flim?
I will look.
I will look.
No, it's still it's autism.
Oh, it's weird for me.
Subscription.
I just went on my browser.
It just oh, it just OK.
Now it's working.
Hey, it's your office.
So everything is back to normal now.
Thank goodness.
And between this and the stream that's next,
I will look into why everything is the big gay basically.
I'll be having this.
Can't be having this.
Outrageous, fruity fruity.
Oh, Rudy.
So, yes, hello, everyone.
Welcome to the number 61.
Soon to be bumped up in one number as soon as they let the BBC let go
of the other the mysterious.
It's going to need another two weeks still on that.
Oh, my goodness.
The BBC are terrible.
Pretty sure that pretty sure that my.
Well, not my ancestors, but pretty sure that the ancestors of people
in this country fought against the British in multiple wars
in order so that we didn't have to worry about the BBC claiming videos on YouTube.
Pretty sure that's in the Constitution, isn't it?
I think so.
It's one of the amendments that they added because of all this
fucking bullshit.
They just said, you know what we're going to do?
We're going to make an amendment.
Now it's constitutional. Now what?
It's pretty outrageous.
Unfortunately, yeah, it's great.
We just hope and pray that Google
finds value in the Constitution.
So cross your fingers.
It's doubtful.
Don't hold your breath.
Yeah, but we can hold out hope.
So, yeah, we the bonus, ifap.
It's it's it's seem like a thing to do.
Bone fat bones fat fat.
I can just have, you know, a moment and then everything will be ready to go.
And wonderful.
We're going to be responding to you Joker videos today with
a returning guest and a technically returning guest.
You know, these these labels, they get very complicated.
But welcome to the show.
Jay Longbone and that style's girl.
How do you both do?
Hi. Good. Hello.
Is that the way you say hi to everyone?
Hi.
It's usually the way girls say it when they're really drunk.
Hmm. Oh, my brain.
My brain's always drunk on its own chemistry alcohol.
Great idea. No, no.
It's time. It's time.
Yeah, we're almost diverse today.
Still not because three guys, two women.
I've heard from several people, including his wife,
the wise wisdom of Anita Sarkeesian.
This is just not enough wisdom.
Why? Yes. Why is them?
How come it's not called wisdom?
I don't know, man.
That's the failing on them, I suppose.
Have you spoken to them about this?
The whites, just them.
Yeah, whenever people say them, it normally is like the straights or
you're one of the leaders of the white on you, the Jews, or they
were referring to the the the straight triarchy. Oh, no.
Oh, it is.
I know it's because I haven't liked today.
We could probably talk about how Mandalorian
is upset and use Sarkeesian because there were no women in it.
And then she was told there were all of our younger viewers.
You might have to remind them of Anita's.
She looks like an internet.
I guess what's what's like like an urban legend like the feminist Onision.
Yeah. Oh, my God.
Like people know about her.
Like everyone knows about her is like a cautionary tale.
But not everyone can quite remember them back in the heyday.
She was like, yeah, I don't know.
Laughing stock. Any good thing that they've done.
I just because nothing.
We would have spoken about her back in the day with
Macintosh because we would we covered his video.
He used to be her editor, right?
Slash manager. I don't know.
Something with a writer.
Maybe I'm almost positive
she dumped him, which is kind of hilarious.
I should have kept him on by Anita Sarkeesian.
Oh, you weren't a weren't a big enough cuck for Anita Sarkeesian.
I said like she dumped him because he's not diverse enough like himself.
He's too much man.
He needs to be more. He's too man.
Non man. Why?
Too white. He's not.
Well, he's not a man.
He's male. Biologically, he's a male.
I don't know if I'd call him a man.
Just because he said I've seen myself a few few man.
Just because he likes TLJ rags, just because he likes TLJ.
Canada disqualifies him.
Well, it's fucking.
What was his argument?
The TLJ is a film about men looning that they need to listen to women.
What? You know, there should be a scene in the film
where that might be a thing that happens, but I guess not.
Listen to women. Let's get us all killed.
I mean, yeah, I was going to say.
Great idea.
So if if I would listen to Leia in the opening, they'd all be dead.
So not a good idea.
No, but the theme
is listen to women.
The theme trumps all.
Yeah. So we are going to meet.
Like I said, we're going to cover some some movie movie, Mr.
Mr. Movie Blob today.
I thought that it would make sense to start with.
Where is that quote?
Where are? Oh, yeah.
So I guess I should I should mention
he's actually acknowledged everyone.
Mr. Movie Blob himself.
He said, everyone, we made it big.
We've been acknowledged by the big man himself.
Vic, Vic, Mario.
Yeah, he said, the youngest old lady.
Someone was asking, like, would he speak to people on the map?
And he said, I can't imagine why any thinking person
would want to have a conversation which is akin to a dead tree
with two mites flowing out of it.
Yeah, that's funny coming from a guy whose brain is complete mattress filling.
Pretty much, you know, with those rings and air.
Whenever he moves around, which isn't often.
Well, man, depends on the mattress.
I suppose you can get like jelly mattresses, a jelly mattress.
But that thing would like pop beneath him.
Unless the mattress is made out of like literal jelly,
and he just submerges himself in it.
I mean, this sounds comfy, at least, right?
Be the jelly. He's like a water bed.
But a person.
I'm like imagining like this big block of jelly
just sitting in his room and you look inside it and he's just floating inside there.
It's how he sleeps.
Well, Connie, with a chance to meet balls
where he makes the Jello house and they get stuck in it.
Oh, but he would be OK with getting stuck in it.
I think he was asked why he wouldn't go on.
And he said that
he wouldn't want to legitimize what we've said about Jenny Nicholson.
So there you go, folks.
He does not approve of a fact.
It's a shame.
If only we were able to be legitimized by movie, Bob.
And there was like this, you know, several of these kinds of comments
from his fan base being like, oh, my God, this crowd, they're like, debate me, debate me.
It's like, I don't think we've ever said that to Bob Shipman.
Ever. We do not have a desire to debate Bob Shipman.
He can come on if he wants to.
But by goodness, I didn't know anybody had a desire to debate Bob.
Just talk to him and listen to him.
His debate conditions would him would be
inviting you to his house and serving you Mountain Dew.
You'd fucking want to murder us, I think you'd be like, it's for the greater good.
Maybe Bob is the only person on YouTube
who stipulations for a debate would involve catering.
I want to I want to show you folks.
I know Rags would have seen this one, but it's just so funny.
Hey, hey, I'm going to send you guys a tweet.
Who wants to read this out?
Anybody interested?
I shall do it. Read out the tweet.
Yes. OK. Let's see.
Oh, should I try and do it in a Bob Shipman voice
or should I just do it in a regular retard voice?
Dealers choice. OK.
Twenty fucking nineteen.
I was supposed to be on a star ship by now.
And bursting with intelligent robots, deciding what sort of body
I'd like to upload my immortal consciousness to.
Instead, we're all still on this fucking rock,
wondering how to placate the right working class.
I will never forgive the troglodytes who stole the future
I earned to prolong their worthless existence.
Wow, he said this is the thing that would be Bob.
Like he probably bathes every once in a while.
So he has to like see himself and he knows what he looks like.
And he wrote this with that understanding.
Oh, he's white.
He's like ghostly white.
So he's like he's like, you know, in Ghostbusters,
there's the big state puffed marshmallow.
Oh, my God. I'm just about to say that he's lighter than that.
Oh, well, this man gets a lot of sun.
No, I don't think he does.
No, he does not.
He does not get a son.
He's wearing shades.
He must go in the sun, right? You wouldn't wear shades inside, right?
It's, you know, you know.
Vitamin D is a product of the working class white man.
Is he married?
Is there a Mrs. Blob?
Mrs. Chipman.
How could you? It's a great surname.
I imagine it's like cool.
Chipman, I bet he's a chip man.
I bet he loves chips.
Wow, rolling out the fact that he is a man of the chip.
Just because you can't make any arguments against his arguments.
That's why you're doing that.
Just because he could vote twice.
Twice. You assume it's only twice.
Yeah, I was going to say, what the fuck?
Well, you know, if if he could give himself the power,
he would make himself supreme dictator of the universe galaxy.
Oh, I've just gotten a message from fucking discord.
You can claim three months of Xbox Game Pass.
Hey, how about that?
Hey, that's not a bad deal. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, we've advocated that before.
It's actually like really good value, but, you know.
Oh, yeah, you can get Gears of War and Jedi Fallen Order
and all sorts of other goodies and video games for your
your console or your computer box.
Basically, all of the things at this point and all the things
if you're looking to get some access to games for the cheapest way,
that's that and like Humble Monthly, probably your best options.
Bumble Huntly, humble.
Oh, yeah. Humble Bundle is amazing.
That's what I that's where I got Vegas from.
Like 20 bucks. Mm hmm.
So, yeah, I mean, I'm not actually, you know, the people.
So we're going to do combine the missing super chats
with the new ones at the end, which means we can kick on to the video.
Is that OK with everybody?
Does anyone want to talk about anything pressing?
Is it? I can't think because it feels weird to me
that we have an intro that's only 20 minutes.
Like that feels wrong, don't it?
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, we could talk about something if you want.
What's been what's been on your mind?
What have you been thinking about?
Literally nothing.
I don't know.
If you think about nothing, doesn't it become something true?
I don't know.
The only thing on my mind is baby Yoda.
And you haven't even seen Mandalorian.
Not a true fan. Hashtag.
You see, that doesn't even know if baby Yoda is
a boy Yoda or a girl Yoda.
Hmm. Maybe this is like you're assuming that it's only a boy or a girl.
Rag. Oh, I'm sorry.
It's I want to be a good trans ally.
I know they're very forgiving bunch.
I don't want to step out of line by assuming baby Yoda is trans.
Yeah, the baby Yoda could be trans identifies as true.
Just by not acknowledging that as a possibility
in any colloquial conversation, I'm oppressing the trans people of the galaxy.
How dare you miss gender, baby Yoda?
It's they them.
Of course. Oh, that's one of you guys heard about this one.
So I saw it on Twitter, Kathleen Kennedy complaining that it's hard
for them to make these sequels because there's no source material to work with.
Yeah, I bet you were.
I bet she works really hard.
Like it's pretty mind blowing.
It's like you deleted the extended universe
and complained that there's nothing to work from.
What the fuck?
It is a fucking thing.
I really want them to adapt Chuck Wendig's novels
because it'll just be such a dumpster fire that it can really be worse
than what we've read in those leaks.
Is it possible? Yes.
It's a Chuck Wendig novel.
He can he can do a real death oochy.
Well, there we we read before the stream began,
Mueller and I watched that Doomcock video he put out an hour and a half,
two hours ago, something like that about these apparently new leaks
that had come out where they were trying to redo a lot of the story stuff.
And it's even worse.
Yeah, it seems like they run. It's bad and worse.
Who do they hire to write this shit?
It's terrible. It's awful.
I hope that Chuck Wendig is like one of the writers.
It would come full circle.
I don't think I'd be able to believe that he'd be able to produce something so poor.
I just also like the idea.
It's like maybe maybe don't do these things if you feel that you have no ideas.
You know, how about that?
Yeah, you could just not buy movies.
You money. Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot about money. That's my bad top.
Fucked up Kathleen Kennedy needs her vaginal tightening reconstruction.
All right. She needs money to pay for that.
She needs to get you think she gets loosened up.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
You're freaking wolf out. Stop the game.
And he doesn't like to think about Kathleen Kennedy's.
Don't say it can't be counted.
Natural counted by unshaven.
Do you think you think she dies it?
Do you get a chance ally to work?
Well, you can do this. You can make it.
So you got a seal.
He has to choose light saber colors.
I got to quit before we even get to cinema with their toe.
Light saber vibrators, light saber vibrators.
Her nethers change color based on whatever the light saber vibrator set to.
It could be yellow, blue.
Why would you go to yellow first?
What's wrong with white, white color?
A beautiful woman.
What's wrong with what's wrong with a yellow?
No. Oh, my.
How you doing there, Rags?
Are they going good?
Cooch Lee Kennedy.
What? No. No.
So, kick rags are drawers.
Kick rags.
I was just someone mentioned to check the EFAB.me site.
There's apparently an EFAB Advent calendar.
I have absolutely no idea what this does. Check this out.
Oh, for Krimath?
Yeah, but like I have no idea what it means.
I think it's like memes or I don't know, calendar.
I can't believe you would refer to Baby Jesus as a memes.
I mean, he's the best meme.
Oh, Advent calendar.
Latest updates. Jesus is the greatest meme.
I'm excited to know what's in there.
But there's also the vault and the vault.
Yeah, if you go in there, it's just EFAB 60 is in the vault.
No, no. Wait, does he have a copy of it?
No, no. Well, I'm like the only person I think who can even access it right now.
But everyone can get a copy as soon as I think it's like 12 more days
and it'll be released.
Yeah, it's like it's like the 12th day of Christmas.
But honestly, my own fucking stream back.
But yes, I don't know.
Actually, like this could be anything.
I actually have no idea.
But, you know, keep keep an eye.
We've got so many little things.
And I got the website, the subreddit, the obviously
the IMDb page we covered last time.
Lots of little communities floating around, connecting
and talking about how Tlj is a very good film.
You know, it's very productive.
I hope they make another one after Tlj that goes into even more excruciating
detail to explain all of the all of the the open plot lines
and questions that were raised in The Last Jedi.
One of the possibilities were, oh, God, it is.
Palpitism survived.
Episode six is that they killed a mere clone of him.
It wasn't him at all.
Yeah, turns out that the triumph,
it turns out that the heroes that you thought were really cool and nifty
and great, turns out they're garbage.
But we've got some cool new characters.
Imagine like maybe you're in as Vader as Vader is dying and talking to Luke.
And then like one of the passing generals is like, by the way,
that wasn't the real Palpatine as he escapes.
And Vader is just like, what?
We did it.
We saved the you the galaxy, except we didn't.
Haha. Gotcha.
And then looks like by the way, we've not really done anything, actually.
With the recon, like Palpatine not being dead, they're being snoke.
They're being this huge army.
And the first order just comes back.
It's like so episode six really didn't do anything then.
Yeah. Like just to clarify, did fuck all.
Oh, you know, people wonder why I'm not a Star Wars fan anymore, man.
But you know, Palpatine.
Palpatine was my favorite.
I was always rooting for him.
So I'm ready to see him.
I do unironically love Palpatine.
I don't love him being back.
Wow. You're not a true fan.
A true fan wants to see as much of a character as possible.
Even when he sucks.
Yeah. Even when he sucks.
More of him is more is better.
It's like, well, didn't even it's like women.
The more women you get to see, the better it is.
I like women. Do you like women?
You know, Wolf, fuck.
See, the last side of the bag, bro.
You're back, bro.
All right. Well, anyway,
here is the link that y'all going to need to be able to view
the incredible video we're going to start.
I was thinking it's time with Nando, but since he's on topic,
I think movie Bob should be given the stage.
Oh, God. I mean, he's such a good man.
He killed me last time.
We'll see. We'll see.
Just drink plenty of water and killers better like property.
Wow, Rags, you're the one that's not in you.
What the fuck?
I did. I click it. OK, yeah, here.
It's working now. It's working now.
I click the thing. There you go. All right.
Yeah, we made it.
This is Bob, after all.
So this is actually a follow up.
And I'm pretty sure it's because everyone was really unsatisfied
with his video and he was like, oh, I better explain what I mean
when I say that there's fucking no message in Joker.
So, oh, you're talking. Oh, oh, how how dare he not replace the O
with an asterisk?
Yes, pretty, pretty fucking horrifying to see that weird blatantly.
Like we need to really censor that. It's very offensive.
I suggest Joker is Joker actually about anything, if not him.
He's the yoker. Oh, no. Oh, yeah. The yoker.
Anyway, the yoker. He come for you.
Here we goddamn diddly dang go. Oh, yeah, that's right.
He worked covering a Joker video.
I thought I was in the Star Wars.
You know, true, true.
We'll have plenty of that.
This is the thing we need to take advantage of all the time
we have not talking about Star Wars because, oh, we got we got a whole month.
Do you got a whole month?
And then oh, yeah, that's right.
And then it'll be nothing but three years worth of more Star Wars
because it'll be just it's just going to be awful.
And we can't talk about Mandalorian because that might actually be good.
So why would we talk about good things, poo?
Yeah, we only hate things here in E-frame applause podcast.
It's not like we have one planned in like four days.
It's all about that.
Why would you say that?
Anyway, they could put like they could super chat a shibe.
A shibe? Yeah.
Look at it. A sheeb?
Well, I don't see it. Where are they coming?
I've seen some books in the live chat.
There's like a little there's a little rags that's waving.
I want to see the little rags.
Gimme. Oh, no. Hold on.
I'll snip it.
OK, yeah, do that thing.
Tool is the greatest thing Windows 10 is ever had.
It's the loneliest number since the number eight point one.
He wasn't all that lonely.
You can't see it being animated because he is way.
He's like actually moving in the super chat.
But there it is.
The sheeb. Yeah, man.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, they added sheeb super chats bafflingly.
You can't send a sheeb and a message.
You have to choose between one or the other.
So why they even seem to have their own space. OK.
No, it's very strange.
There is there is incredibly
very selectively competent this Google people are.
This is a cool look.
Pretty cool. They added
that of all things, because they must they must be a fan of the fab then.
Right. Because I don't see how else that could have come along.
Yeah, they've got it.
They've got the sheep for me.
They've got some kind of gas mask creature for me.
Or there's multiple of them.
People keep sending them in.
Oh, my goodness. Here, let me.
I don't have to do this on my laptop because it won't work for me otherwise.
Super sticker. Oh, there's a peach.
So they have looks like a bum bum.
They've got a they've got a pair, obviously.
Che Longbo. They've totally isn't a
this isn't an excuse for you to send us more super chats or anything.
Oh, my God. Look at that one.
I don't look at that one.
Who's who's the hippo?
Who's the hippo?
Who's the hippo?
Is it movie bomb?
Is movie bomb the hippo? Oh, my God.
Hippos are the deadliest animal in Africa.
Could the same be said for a movie, Bob?
Stay tuned to find out.
They don't show up on like these make a human thumb.
There's a big bomb.
I end up killing an African on this stream.
They show up on the live chat.
They don't show up in the like video chat, which is the big gay.
But all right. That's stupid.
Oh, my God. It's an Egyptian one.
Oh, and it's like always on a shinobi one.
I can't tell how to mistake.
How did you mistake a Japanese outfit for Egyptian?
Because it doesn't look like either of them.
I look like an Egyptian.
Also, it's got like a it's got like party poppers at the bottom of it.
There's a lot of things this could be.
Oh, my goodness.
He's got a little samurai outfit and he's got his flag.
He's got a big heart.
He's squeezing the heart and he's not he's got his fireworks.
By the way, we're a hateful Nazi podcast.
Can you please read that?
His sparklers.
Yeah, I can't wait for the the Twitter outrage over this.
And then we'll have to link them to this part of the stream.
We're all like a chance.
We're all fording over little teddy bears.
I'm glad we're not trans allies or they'd be down our fucking throats right now.
Over the teddy bears.
I got little little fans.
I love these. These are amazing.
It's weird, though, that they wouldn't let you say that one's creepy.
There's a lemon that kisses a heart to you.
Cynic snacks.
What are you what are you doing?
Why is there a lemon person in this world?
Oh, why would cynic snacks be a lemon?
No, he's clearly giving us a lemon person because he doesn't want it because it's creepy.
Oh, I thought you meant the lemon was cynic snacks.
Well, that's very strange.
You'd have to explain it's pretty cool.
They made a bunch of emotes exactly inspired by rags, though, like specifically.
It's pretty cool. I know. That's crazy.
I think I had to take off my shades for legal reasons. Mm hmm.
Pretty new rule from YouTube like shades or a gateway drug or something.
So every one of the little characters for a super stickers,
they have like a name and a bio, right?
The bio for the sheep is his name is Bushiva.
All right. Mm hmm.
When Bushiva lost his owner, male confirmed,
he turned to a life of motorcycles and mischief.
But now he's turning over a cool new leaf.
Motorcycles and Mischief, huh?
Sounds a lot like the Dawn's pet, if you know what I mean.
Oh, my goodness.
Motorcycles and mischief.
Oh, I can't believe two two wheeled automobiles and sexual harassment.
Oh, my God. Sign me up.
Um, Dream Machine.
Anyway, it's to go on the other end of the spectrum entirely.
Who's ready for movie, Bob?
Me, I am not.
I, I can't.
Oh, I don't think you're ready for all this jelly.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Not the jelly.
I ain't jelly about like how it says view at your own risk.
It's so applicable.
View at your own risk.
Oh, God, that's like speaking to us from the gelatinous cube in his room.
I'm going to be really disappointed.
Oh, yeah.
He lives in the jar.
We established this in the bottle or.
The lemon person's there when they're when you know what to do.
Draw the lemon person.
I love. No, not the lemon person.
Draw the cinema Roberto in a giant jelly cube.
Giving out commands through like little
there's going to be little wires connected to his brain
that go outside of the cube into a PC.
Oh, the only way it makes sense.
Apparently, there's an item in Pokémon Sword and Shield called P.P. up.
That's been an old Pokémon.
P.P. up. Yeah. Yeah.
But yeah, but it's funny now.
It's funny now.
Because I learned about it, which made it funny.
OK. Oh, they get a bottle of P.P.
Frank, this is your last chance.
If you want to leave, it says view at your own risk.
Like this is a serious thing.
Listen, I've got my bottle of P.P. up.
My P.P. is up. I am ready.
Why would you P.P. be up?
My body is. Fucking cinema Roberto.
Oh, no, it's so we need to have a time.
No, so that by the time we're done, my P.P.
will be at its normal size because normally it would like shrink into itself.
OK. Fucking up the bottom of my desk, though.
I'm sure you'll take care of that soon enough.
Escapist magazine.
So for those of you who are feeling possibly confused
as to exactly how this month's two a week show schedule works for me.
Fuck. This is the stupid one where he speaks super fast.
This is Bob and his natural habitat.
I don't like it.
He's super fast because he forces me to consider slowing him down.
And that makes it longer.
Is his father the micromachines guy for the fun?
Like, I can't explain this.
I don't know why he does this.
And I always assumed he was just trying to copy Yahtzee
because Yahtzee speaks really fast.
But you can like follow Yahtzee's through line when he speaks with Bob.
You're like, I'm sorry, you just use seven words with eight syllables each.
His trick is that he says one word at a time
because, of course, he can't speak that fast.
I mean, he's breathing, you know, he's fat.
Even chat is saying we have to slow him down and then just like puts it together.
I think we did figure out that slowing him down was the way to defeat him.
So I'm going to slow him down a little bit.
I think so.
Because it's a slow and old movie, Bob.
Yes. Yeah.
I think we're going to have that's what we had to do last time,
because movie Bob can take like a word like big,
but he could say it with two syllables.
Big, big, big.
OK, I don't even know. I can't do it.
So for those of you who are feeling
possibly confused as to how this month is to a week.
Oh, shit. It's echoing from Anna's mic, I think.
I don't know what I do.
Yeah. Two bobs for the price of one.
No, it's not the deal we were asking for.
All right. It was getting worse all the time.
We will contract the turbo autism if we have to listen to it twice.
So I guess maybe it's coming through your speakers or.
OK, so how do I fix it so that way it does not do that?
Oh, well, plug your speakers and destroy them.
We will not be able to hear it.
Are you? Wait, so you're listening to all of us three speakers?
Yeah. Oh, I'm surprised it's working as well.
Do you do you have like a like a headset like someone in 2019 might have?
Nope. OK, we've maybe turn.
If the microphone isn't picking us up and you can still hear us,
that means that you could probably turn him down to a degree
where he's not picked up by your thing, but you can still hear him, right?
Yeah, go to the the watch together and lower lower the volume on that.
Just lower him as much as you can so that you can still hear him.
But he won't echo. Hopefully that works.
OK, let's try it and let's see if this works. I just did it.
All right. Here we go.
Week show schedule works on Tuesdays.
Regular episodes of The Big Picture on Thursday.
Special Halloween themed episodes for October.
Why are we talking about doing it?
Still like a little bit. Yeah, you still need to make the blob.
Go away. No, no, no, no.
We need blob. We need the blob.
We need no need him to go away.
Beware the blah.
All right, I'll like back up and hold my microphone.
My speakers. What's what microphone are you using out of curiosity?
Blue snowball.
Is there like a mute button or anything sort of physical or is it?
What do they call it? The yellow snowball?
Yeah, but yeah, like on the on the yeah, that's a sorry.
I'll just mute myself on here when the video plays.
Yeah, sure. That should work.
OK, I think he's just talking about the actual video coming out right now.
Picture on Thursday's special Halloween themed episodes for October.
Why are we talking about Joker again already?
Because I didn't really want to.
But I also kind of do anyway.
They're putting some people on the screen.
Hey, man. Wolf thinks those guys are handsome.
Gay confirmed.
Whoa, who likes the big.
Yeah, it slipped out eventually.
Yeah. Everyone put G in chat for gay.
All right. It kind of explains why he hates women so much.
Probably. Yeah, the gays infamously do hate women.
Yeah, because they can't use their mind control powers on the women.
Mm hmm. Not so stay tuned for that, too. Anyway.
So distorted.
Just like moving up.
It also sounds like this theme for like a really fat guy walking.
He's like, oh,
like he's playing like a private detective.
He's the only detective called Joe Hamhock.
There's like the only thing it's missing is a tuba.
Don't do it.
When he's in a crime scene, there's like a fucking knife on the floor.
He's like, oh, geez.
OK, I'm going to kneel right down.
I'm going to leave my grandmother at the right nearly at four p.m.
I can imagine his knees creaking like an old floorboard if he tries to bend.
He's like the first detective to operate on a fucking scooter.
He's just like where we go on a rascal.
So he's just a less attractive Paul Blart.
Land ho, bitches.
I imagine never movie.
Bob goes swimming like Spain tries to claim him as a new world.
He just rolls around wherever he needs to go.
He's there. He lives.
He lives in like a like a hobbit house where all the doors circle.
Oh, my goodness.
This is what you'll never talk to us now.
No, you'll never fucking talk to us anyway.
The fuck you'll never just envelop your boy.
No, if we think about his enormous girth, he'll never be your friend.
If he tried to sled down a hill, do you think he'd just roll
and turn into a really big snowball by the bottom?
Yes. Can he get white with snow?
Make him wider.
They make him darker.
He'd become more of his fated enemy.
I look like a powdered donut hole.
Detective Hamhock here.
I've fallen down a cliff and I'm gaining speed.
I don't want to see Bob's donut hole.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
This is a serious.
This is a serious podcast.
Very serious.
I want to somebody fund Produce Direct, complete the show.
Detective Hamhock, I will pay for this.
Have him reach Gotham for Batwoman
and become here like you're like mentor.
I know like a red wine punch.
I love you.
And hey, look, all these means great story.
This can work in cinema.
Roberto's favor because he wants diversity.
And I mean, how many like heroes can you think of who have diabetes?
Diabeto, I can't think of many any type.
Oh, God, Diabeto, that could be his name.
Oh, Diabeto.
He's like a Avengers villain.
Think Diabeto. No, no, no.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Someone draw him like a magneto, except he's got diabetes.
Get all the back of his face.
He's losing out of the fucking mask.
I'm in his helmet.
He's whereas Magneto can control metal.
Diabeto controls sugar.
So just keep it as long as you keep him away from like candy store and stuff.
If he goes there, he'll be unstoppable.
Yeah, whatever you saw in me, I fried it with my family.
Oh, no, you know why.
Thus seated next to her, he draws the iron out of the blood.
He's destroying sugar out of them.
Oh, you've been drinking a lot of soda pop.
Instead of like a metal helmet, he's wearing like a birthday cake or something.
Oh, he's wearing one of those helmets that has the like the cans on it.
You drink.
Oh, yeah. Fuck. What are they called?
I don't even know.
Weird people, hats, weird people, hats.
They can't just drink normally.
God, diabetes.
Your chicken will not be safe.
Your pizza will not be safe.
Your gingerbread houses will not be safe.
And they are mine to control.
Diabeto is his sidekick, Cheeto Cheeto.
Fucking the diabetic Cheeto.
Sorry, you haven't even made a point yet.
I'm like, we'll get there.
Let's take a moment to appreciate Holmes Gould.
Holmes Gould, yes.
Yeah.
Hilarious.
It's really funny.
So Joker made a bunch of money at the box office over the weekend,
which is being treated as a surprise for purposes of further marketing,
as though the idea that a movie about probably the second most popular character
and one of the most popular franchises in the most popular movie genre on the planet
for like the last decade of human history,
pulling a big number opening uncontested in early fall,
is some kind of miraculous.
Is he aware of all the movies that have failed?
Yeah, yeah.
Apparently not.
And the big thing about it was they did it without China's help.
That's the thing.
How does he explain this?
How does he explain Justice League?
Like, what the fuck, dude?
We got Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg
all headlining a movie and it fucking failed.
That was different because it's not totally acceptable.
This is the equivalent of like he meets us in like battle in fucking Gotham
and he's like, that's different.
You can't say this Diabito away.
But your arguments, Diabito, your arguments.
Yes, it was a surprise.
The Joker did this well.
I don't think anybody could have predicted it was going to make over a billion.
But that's like, yeah, that's definitely a surprise.
And as for the other movies that were competing with Joker.
What what what other movies had kind of came out,
you know, alongside of Joker that might have,
you know, taken away its movie.
Is that part of his point that they didn't have competition?
Well, it had Gemini Man, Will Smith.
Well, I mean, Will Smith, true big actor.
Well, he not like biggest movie, Bob, but he's big actor, famous.
You know, we had Adam's family.
Yeah. Oh, God.
I heard it was the death of cinema, apparently.
Death of cinema.
Yeah. Brown table said it was the death of cinema.
The Adam's family.
Um, let's see, what else what else came out?
I don't even know.
Abominable was going out.
Yeah, we had abominable.
I had some movie about.
Um. I guess the abominable snowman, the Gettys.
Like in like in the third, is it the sequel to movie?
Happy Feet is the abominable.
No big or like Bigfoot or some or big feet.
No, there was last time they came out with another Getty movie
and then is abominable animated yeti movie.
Rule, no, we've got we have small foot.
We have small foot unless.
OK, there's there's actually been apparently
a lot of fucking Bigfoot movies recently.
I've been out where we have abominable.
We have small foot.
We have missing link.
We have the son of Bigfoot.
We have a mission, Kathmandu.
And we have chill out, Scooby Doo.
But that was from 2007.
So it's probably I've seen that.
Yeah, how is it?
From what I remember, it was just OK.
It is OK. Oh, oh, remember years and years ago
when they started kind of redoing the Scooby Doo movies,
you had Scooby Doo and Zombie Island, which was the best.
That was a good one.
Zombie Island was great.
Yeah, Zombie Island was great.
You had Scooby Doo and the witch's ghost.
The witch's ghost.
That was pretty good.
You had Scooby Doo meets the aliens or whatever it was.
Oh, yeah, that's the one was a cyber trail or something cyber.
Yeah, there was that.
There was also. Yeah, yeah.
There was when they go to Australia and there's the vampire like band.
Yeah, that was that was actually part of the witch's ghost.
So the hex girls, no, so there's another Scooby Doo where they go to Australia
and there's like this rock band that's playing, but then a vampire
like when he's in like the bat kind of form comes up and they find out
it's just an illusion, but there's an actual vampire.
I have no idea.
I had no idea about it came out a few years after.
So the witch's ghost and the zombie one came out in the beginning
of those series of movies.
The one I'm talking about is a little bit like maybe eight years after that.
And the curse of the Australian vampire band.
So, oh, we're talking about Scooby Doo and the legend of the vampire.
Yeah, so that's the only good Australian.
Yeah, that's that's what I put in.
That's what I put into Google Scooby Doo and the curse of the Australian vampire.
And I've been made aware of the Bob Chippen celebrated Captain Marvel
for being out the one billion score, as though it's a shock that it's like,
uh-huh, the film is between the two biggest fucking movies.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, shocker.
Apparently that is, you know, surprising, but Joker, a movie that's disconnected
from the DCEU made by a director with like no expectation of creating
something amazing, I mean, you know, I don't know, I don't know,
I mean, you know, I know a lot of people like the hangover movies.
I'm pretty sure I do as well, but nobody was expecting that.
How would you not know if you like them or not?
Maybe that's what or not, because I'm pretty sure I do, too.
Did I say that to the hangover?
Yeah, hangover.
Maybe maybe I had a brain fart because I was like, I know I like the first one.
I can't remember what I think of the rest of them.
So so the second one is where they're in Thailand
and he gets the tattoo on his face.
The one guy gets his finger chopped off.
Oh, my God, maybe I didn't see it.
Oh, and yeah, they have to get the monkey that is a drug dealer.
Yeah, I don't think I saw it.
Oh, yeah, it's all coming together.
Yes. Oh, yeah.
No. And then the third one is where John Goodman is in it.
And so he's the one that I guess Mr.
Chow stole all of his gold.
So they have to go get the rest of the gold from Mr.
Chow's old house.
And then you find out that the gold was actually the gold
that John Goodman already had.
So they ended up stealing the other half of his gold.
And then Alan gets married.
What do you do?
You sound like you remember them.
How good were they, do you think?
What would you say, Alan?
Oh, Alan, I'm glad he was able to get married.
Yeah, he gets married to what's her name.
Oh, my God, that is a hologram McCarthy, McCarthy or something.
Melissa McCarthy.
Yes, he is married to her.
I'm so sorry. Oh, Senator McCarthy.
Hey, which of the hex girls was your favorite?
Which one was Wolf Wolf?
He's abandoned the podcast.
Fuck. All right.
Mueller, which of the hex girls would you bone?
Why? Well, why wouldn't all of them have the answer of this question?
All of them is obviously the answer.
All right.
We'll start from the top.
Jay Longbone, which of the hex girls would you be on first?
Nigga, I watched that shit.
Oh, man. You don't like Scooby Doo?
No, I watched the original show when I was a kid.
I didn't get into all the spinoff stuff and the newer stuff.
Hmm. I don't know why.
And this stuff came out in like the early 2000s, right?
I don't know, Rags, you just googled it.
What years did those come out?
Well, let me let me check the Scooby Pedia.
So like they've been in multiple iterations.
And so it seemed to have got like a game version here and a cartoon.
Yeah, so there's the cyberspace one.
So that's the one where they go through different
like levels of cyberspace through the video game.
And because they're at a carnival, you know, I shouldn't put Google on screen.
Who knows what's going to come up?
I've got to be careful.
Oh, yeah, they they they they appeared in Scooby Doo and the witch's ghost.
They were in Scooby Doo and the legend of the vampire.
They were also in what's new Scooby Doo.
And yeah, they made some appearances here.
Yes, because they were so popular.
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Did you watch the ones where it was just Scooby Shaggy and Scrappy?
Oh, the old ones.
Well, they had the Boo Brothers and they had the one
where they were teaching like the monsters.
So all the like scary monsters from the.
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
Yeah, the problem is that Scrappy is a little fucking cunt
and it was really hard for even like a child.
They made it up with Scrappy.
They made him a villain in the movie, didn't they?
Because they're like, people hate Scrappy.
They did.
Absolutely. Because Scrappy's a little asshole.
I don't know. I like Scrappy.
Like if you could have you could have a you could have a lake of acid
in Scrappy would be like, I'm going to go beat the fucking acid up acid.
It's so cute because Shaggy just picked him up because he's so little
and he's like trying to punch him and his like hands are moving,
his little legs are moving, but he can't like touch anything
because he's getting held up. It's so cute.
Can't you just appreciate the spirit of him?
Rags, the spirit, the spirit of the spirit of Scrappy.
I wish he was just a spirit.
Wow. Scrappy is the kind of nigga who will slap your girl on the ass in the club.
And then be like, it's so good.
So good girls ass in the club.
That's that's that is typical Scrappy.
Scrappy behavior.
Scrappy.
Then he just punt him out the front door because he's a small thing.
Like, but then he figures out how to get back in because he's small and he's nifty.
Yeah. So
well, what are we thinking?
What are we thinking, Anna?
We think in Thorn, Dusk or Luna, who's going first?
For what?
For who?
OK, which of the three members of the Hex Girls, who'd you bone first?
Um, none because they're not men.
Oh, my God. That's so sad.
I'm not being you know, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm not attracted to women.
Matt Moller.
Yeah, I'm going for the black.
This is this.
Um, not if not.
I'm going to base it on hair pretty much.
I like the black hair.
Who's got black hair?
The middle one, Dorn.
No, it's like dark red.
It is black, but it has like a red highlight to it.
Well, it's like whenever it looks black, but whenever the sunlight hits it,
you can tell like, oh, that is that's really dark red.
It's like blood red.
Well, that's a trick that they used in animation is so that if your character
has like a, you know, black hair, like even like a black mask,
they put like a highlight on it.
So that way you can see the character against the background,
especially when the backgrounds are going to be night.
So that's why she has the red.
Oh, well, the two of them have the red then because there was orange blossom.
Uh, uh, Luna is her name.
The keyboarder person lady keyboard person.
I don't want to I don't want to say keyboardman.
That's very rude.
The keyboard, the keyboardist, the penis.
And yes, so movie, Bob.
Now that we've settled, now that we've settled the way, what was your choice?
Right? What was your choice?
Oh, I'm absolutely fucking thorn first.
All right. Yeah.
OK. I'm glad that was important.
Bob, you may continue now aid of human history.
Pulling a big number opening uncontested in early fall
is some kind of miraculous unexpected victory for the film and its fans
against the overwhelming adversary of marginally divided reviews
from professional critics.
And it's pretty underselling it a little with how this movie was covered by the media.
Yeah, it was down to like 50 something originally.
Not to mention just the headlines.
They were like trying to kill that movie before it even came out saying,
oh, don't go to the theater.
You're going to get shot if you go to a theater and watch this movie.
Yeah, we covered Jenny Nichols, and she was like, I didn't go to a normal theater.
I went to drive in theater to improve my survival odds.
Oh, yeah. You know what?
I actually don't believe her on that because she and I.
You don't. Here's the thing rags.
She and I live relatively close together.
And me and my friend, Sav, we like to go to drive ins.
But hey, guess what? There's none down here.
And I was like, huh, she went to go see Joker.
Let me let me go through and find all the drive ins around me
and what days they were out.
Her evidence is not lining up.
It's not. No.
There was a good chance she made it up on the spot to be like, look how
like I did that is evidence of like the quick, I guess.
And then when she's called out how much it doesn't make sense, she was just like,
no, like, oh, he's he's levitating marshmallows.
Is that right? Oh, are those marshmallows or chiclets?
I thought they were sugar cubes.
Yeah, I thought they were cubes for a second there.
Oh, are they not?
I can't tell very well in this picture.
Oh, it's perfect.
You're like my room.
It's a place.
He's looking pretty good there.
It's like he's lost a lot of weight.
Good stuff, Bob.
He wears the he wears the shades under the mask, I guess.
Do you think it's hard to fit them under there?
I think so.
So what is what is Sennema Roberto said so far?
Oh, you missed him saying that it was no shock.
This movie did well because it's a part of a big franchise.
So why is everyone raving about that?
Why is everyone raving about the fact that I did well?
Because we know what I'll just play it again.
Like you, Bob.
We'll get what we're happy on this.
All right. Get ready.
So Joker made a bunch of money at the box office of the weekend,
which is being treated as a surprise for purposes of further marketing
as though the idea that a movie about probably the second
most popular character and one of the most popular franchises
in the most popular movie genre on the planet for like the last decade
of human history pulling a big number opening uncontested in early fall
is some kind of miraculous unexpected victory for the film and its fans
against the overwhelming adversary of marginally.
Go ahead. OK, Bob, let me let me try to explain this to you
in a way that your small mind can possibly understand.
It is a shock that a movie that is not attached to the DCEU
as it currently stands, a movie made by the guy who is known
for making the hangover films and a movie that is rated R has done this well.
That's why it's a surprise, not because it's a superhero movie,
but because it's completely detached from the current superhero movies
made by a guy who really, you know, one would ever think
he'd make a good superhero movie and it's rated R and it
I mean, it broke the record for a highest rated a lot of records,
which is the most objective evidence we can have in terms of it
doing better than expected. It's beating out records.
I'm just glad it's a surprise at all by it.
I watched the trailer and I was like, this is going to be a really good movie.
It's probably going to make a lot of money.
I can't say I was I was expecting to do OK
because it wasn't attached to anything.
And it was just this movie about a character that they're calling Joker.
And it's like, I didn't know how good it was going to be.
Yeah, just to support that, by the way,
do you hear that he said the second most popular character in the franchise?
He's referring to Batman being more popular.
So how does he explain Justice League?
I will keep coming back to that.
I mean, isn't like the whole appeal of the Dark Knight being the Joker?
Like no one talks about Batman in that movie.
Yes, because even Christian Bale has regrets about his portrayal
of Batman in that movie.
It's just like Batman's fine in that movie.
And that's kind of almost what you could call an issue.
It's like he's not.
Maybe it's like it's a lot of people talk about whether or not it's Batman
or Bruce Wayne that's boring or both or not boring, but not interesting enough.
I don't know if it's just hard to be interesting when you're acting alongside
someone like Heath Ledger as Joker can be tough.
Well, that one dude did it in The Knight's Tale.
Yeah. Why would you?
So if it's false, it's actually not the Joker in that.
He's a completely different character.
There were listeners.
That's a great point.
You guys. Chat backed me up.
A Knight's Tale.
Yeah, it's a good film, but what are you talking about?
Well, you're like, it's hard to you were you were like, hey,
it's hard to stand out when you're next to Heath Ledger.
But I was like, oh, yeah, well, what about a specified Heath Ledger Joker?
You you disingenuous person.
No, Heath Ledger.
He played kind of a Joker character.
They told some jokes in that.
Oh, he was kind of a.
Rags, you're not appreciating.
You're not appreciating Stay Puff, Bob.
On on on Rick Von Lichtenstein.
Ork Von Lichtenstein.
I knew much more about him.
His head fits so perfectly out of that body.
What's the photo?
Oh, it's Bob's face on it.
It looks exactly like him.
We are becoming the same thing that we saw.
Does he have dimples or is that just his cheekbones?
I don't we this is forever.
We don't know.
My theory was that he had a horrible accident
where his face was stretched open and the surgery couldn't fix it all.
Do you think his head's like a pufferfish and like
when he's like not angry, his face like sucks in on itself?
Oh, it could be.
I think it's weird that someone who's so large has cheekbones like that.
That's the thing.
I don't know what's going on there.
Because when you get older, like with your dimples, I notice that,
especially on men, is they kind of become wrinkles that are just lines
in your cheeks like that.
Like what's the guy from Game of Thrones that
Catlin's brother, Heath Ledger?
No, smaller game of Thrones, Catlin's brother.
Well, I know this one.
Did the dude who was useless and everything?
Yeah, the one that had me or Kelly.
So he I you know, he's got the lines on his face on his cheeks.
And I realized I'm like, OK, so he had dimples and that that's the wrinkles
from his dimples. So that's kind of like movie bop here.
So I think he just has dimples.
Yes, as Nathan T just highlighted, he's both fat and gaunt.
It's very odd.
He is font.
One of his dimples could pass as a swimming pool.
No, don't say that just because he probably sweats a lot.
No, I don't even suggest that.
I can't believe you would say that on national television.
Victory.
No one assumed that until you said something.
Global saturation.
If you're going to say that, you have to put on the accent.
Do it.
Crass.
Crass.
No, yeah.
Crass.
You see, I'm to global saturation.
Crass, crass.
Oh, we.
Rezzy, well, five is terrible, but it's so great.
And how terrible it is.
It kind of is. It really it's a specialism.
OK, hey, hey, let's see what he has to say about Joker.
OK, let's do it.
I'm glad that I made a lot of money.
As am I. I'm fucking it's the fucking one crumb of hope
we got in this terrible year of movies.
Crass, crass.
The one crumb of hope.
Crass.
It made a lot of money, crass.
Arebaros, Joker, Crass.
Why do people keep asking for it?
Well, what is the hex girl question?
I don't know what that means.
You have to answer which one of the.
All right, let's get up, do it.
All right.
I'm glad I'm glad that you're here again.
Well, if it's good, we're glad to have you back.
So are you familiar with the hex girls?
No.
Well, let me tell you.
So are you familiar with Scooby Doo and the witch's ghost?
No, you're like Jay.
You haven't seen anything.
You don't see any real films.
You haven't seen any real films.
I haven't seen a Scooby Doo movie since I was like 10 Scooby Doo.
And the witch's ghost came out way back in like 2000, something like that.
Long tisms ago.
Now, there's a band of vampire ladies, but they weren't really vampires,
but they thought they were vampires called the Hex Girl.
They're they're they're wiccans, wiccans.
You're right.
Willow's a part of this group that Willow.
She doesn't play a musical instrument in the band.
There's only three girls.
But this one time a band camp, she did.
Well, that's some deep referencing.
We've just done that.
I like it.
I'll get you a picture of the Hex Girls here.
And you can tell me which one you want to bone first.
Why did you say that?
Like a ball mischievous voice?
When you want to because why would you be seriously greasy as hell?
No, right there.
Tell me which one you'd bone with.
Rockstar ladies pretending to be witches.
You're like, all right, so greasy.
You want to bone them.
All right. So that those are the Hex Girls.
Definitely not the one on the left.
She looks like she has autism.
I know she's like better from the well, it's a bad analogy.
She's right. Stay away from that comparison.
This I got to I got to go with a hard middle.
The middle, hard for the middle.
I agree. I think the chicken that's thorn, right?
Oh, my gosh, is the edgiest name.
I think I've heard.
Yeah, thorn.
But what are the other two names again?
Dusk and Luna.
I'm guessing Dusk is the retard.
Dusk is the retard.
The one on the left.
Oh, my goodness.
We can't say that.
So Luna is the pianist.
Whoa, dude. Get out of your system.
Get out of your system.
Come around, seeing that.
Luna's on the right. That's Luna.
Dusk is on the left because she's often left in the dust.
I don't know. Yeah, the dusk.
She she's she bites the dusk whenever all the the boys come around
because they're like, Oh, did we get on this? Exactly.
Well, what I have is this very I actually don't know.
We were talking about scrappy.
Rags is a big. No, it's fine.
I don't actually know how we got to talking about.
Should we let Bob make another point?
I'm curious where he's going to go with this. OK, fine.
He already made one that was really wrong.
He's he's one for one zero for one.
The maths like it depends.
I don't know. This one's like, man, this one's like it's like
a non point sort of like, I guess some people were really surprised.
He's doing the thing where it's like you shouldn't even be shocked by this.
And it's like anyone could be shocked for any fucking reason.
There's plenty of reason to be shocked by this.
I'm not. I send some scattering over
hyping of random concern trolling in the national media.
I'm deflated.
A fitting end for you, Joker, which.
Oh, no, Joker's wonderful editing.
I read a lot of calm diabetes is become diabetes.
Hey, it means that he knows his shit.
He's referencing the old stuff.
That's true.
They were called people are telling me to adjust my setting
so that with a microphone only picks up me in discord.
I don't know how to do that, though.
Um, whatever you need to do might be something
that ends up being a little bit too complicated for now.
Like whatever you've been doing from now is just this working.
So could you hear it this last time?
I don't think so.
But if we do, we'll be like, you know,
OK, because I just put my hands over the microphone.
All right, then.
Burned up, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Damn it.
Anna, you're familiar with this, this Scooby Doo movie, then.
Is this person in the chat telling the truth
when they say fun fact fact dusk tried to hook up with the dog?
What dog Scooby Doo Scooby Doo?
You know, the other dog in the show, there are other dogs are scrappy doo.
I was going to say there is the Labrador from the space one alien.
And yeah, it's fucking hot heading Scooby,
but they don't try to hook up with him unless it happens in the one where Scooby
gets turned into a man, but I'd have to.
Oh, my goodness.
I look up Scooby Doo as a human.
Oh, my God.
Don't quote me on that.
I'd have to go back and watch them.
But the reason why these are all so fresh in my memory is because
my stepdaughter has been watching, you know, crappy TV shows.
So I'm like, no, you're going to get to my God.
Hence we say, oh, oh, my God.
Yeah, he looks like he looks like he looks like a Jewish.
He looks like a what?
A Jewish penis.
Oh, I just spit out my juice.
I love. Oh, why?
You're the one who brought it up.
Didn't you already have a mental image in your head?
That's a nose right there.
He could he could drive that.
Oh, my goodness.
He can sniff a shekel 10 miles away.
I can almost feel Ben Shapiro blushing.
I'm to be fair, if we are friends of all of the Jewish people
includes scooby doo nasty, terrible jokes that they're telling about.
This is scooby doo.
His ethnicity is dog.
I don't know what you want.
Why is he they gave him a brown T shirt, I guess.
Well, yeah, so he's got a really fucked up face.
And he has one big two.
Yes, he has a brown shirt. Yes.
Where's this yarmulke?
All right. It's it's there.
It's just hidden by the hair.
You know, what's cool is that you guys didn't know that this image existed
before, and it was awesome being here to experience your guys introduction
to scooby doo as a man.
Oh, my goodness.
I didn't know that scooby doo is actually a person
yet a terrible accident with a transmogrifier.
I was going to say the horrible reveal that this is a prequel episode
before he got turned into a dog.
And he just he's been begging for help this whole time.
He just can't get it out.
Do you guys ever watch the show where there were teenagers?
And so it's Scooby and Shaggy when like Scooby's a puppy puppy
and Shaggy's a teenager and he has Scooby's dog house in the backyard.
That's actually like a mansion underground.
Can I go? Oh, that's that's a pup named Scooby Doo, right?
Yeah. Yeah, that show is garbage.
Oh, my God, I love this part.
I remember.
I was going to say Rags was brutal reality.
No, it's a dumb show.
The show is dumb.
And Fred Fred into it.
Idiot. I'm sorry.
Someone at the chat called him Scooby Jew.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no. Why would you say that?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Scooby, Scooby, Scooby Jew to the master race.
Don't even what is that even a parody of?
Oh, no, we're going to we're going to get a bunch of people
doing the Scooby Jew titles now.
Oh, no. Congratulations.
Well, here I didn't like this joke or have this happen.
Fred and Idiot.
And they made Velma insanely smart and she did everything
because she's so smart and she just is insufferable.
Well, Rags intelligent.
They made Fred an idiot. Yeah, I do.
Well, that's why I've talked to Lauren when I watched it.
Well, I haven't seen it since it came out on Cartoon Network.
Back in the number one cartoon network.
No, no, no, no, no.
We're not going to get into a tangent couch again.
So let's go and let's talk.
The last thing we want to do is get onto a tangent.
Oh, is Joker actually about anything?
We need. Yeah, we would do it.
We're on. We're doing it.
We got. Oh, my God.
Sorry about this.
I had to play this edit again and for you, Joker,
which you may recall turned bizarrely political
when director Todd Phillips,
previously best known for Road Trip, the Hangover trilogy
and the feature adaptation of Starsky and Hutch,
stated that his making the film was inspired by traditional comedy
having been killed by, quote unquote, woke culture
and laid up in the negative reviews on the far left.
So there's a certain irony.
I mean, I mean, I mean, it's like 90.
When you when you slow down, I mean.
You know, when you showed me that clip from earlier in the video,
I noticed that like slowing him down, you realize he mispronounces
like every third word he does is.
I don't know how to explain it.
A lot of people say it's his Boston accent slipping in.
I'm just like, I think, oh, he's from Boston.
This actually makes sense.
Yeah, at least that's what I've been told.
I got lasagna caught under his tongue.
That's what that's the problem.
Irony.
Craz.
Yeah, I don't know.
I think the I don't I don't find those comments to be unfair.
The idea that he's like, I don't want to do comedy anymore
because it's too difficult to actually tell a lot of different jokes
because you'll get in trouble for them.
It's like, yeah, I went to drama.
I mean, wasn't he proven right after the show, after the after the movie
was released anyway, like, oh, there's going to be shootings.
Yeah, I mean, the people who are missing with fucking reason, it was offensive.
Let's let's see what Roberto Scott to say about how wrong he is.
I think great.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait. What's happening?
What?
What's going on?
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Hang on a minute.
Oh, my goodness, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, oh, my goodness.
He's so comfy in his gelatinous cute.
This looks like a new style as well, but this isn't for Baywood or anything.
No, it's it's from the commissioner mimic.
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no. There's another one.
Well, if you're scaring me, what's happening?
He's a puffer fish.
Oh, my goodness.
You're a carrot, you fat bastard.
Carrot, you fat bastard.
This is named the name of the stream, but even Carrot, you fat.
You fat episode 60, whatever.
You think you're a you fat bastard.
Oh, my goodness.
Don't. But what movie?
You realize we're going to be on pageants for so many hours.
He's going to tweet out.
Apparently this podcast made a 10 hour video about me.
I am. And this time it'll be true about you guys are sexist.
Oh, you covered him before in his opinions or shit.
We're just here for the lols of this point.
We're not sexist. We're fattest.
Yes. That is actually true.
We're ableist because we prefer people are able to move.
Yeah, healthy at all sizes, you fucking bigots.
We're mobilists.
We give privilege to those who are mobile.
That's the point, though, that's so cruel.
The point, though, that movie Bob is going to make here
is movie Bob is going to try and say that, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Woke, cancel culture.
That's not a thing.
I mean, not everyone is not literally everyone is canceled.
Not literally everything is is turned away.
No, not everyone's getting fired.
We're not trying to ruin everyone's life.
Therefore, this guy's concerns about cancel culture are super dumb.
I mean, it wasn't why it was back in like mid-September, right?
You had that new comedian who was hired for S&L as a writer
and then he got fired because he said homophobic
kings in his podcast and stuff like that.
And I fucking hate people who say cancel culture is the thing
because their life didn't get ended.
Like, that's not the fucking you fucking idiot.
Like, yeah, cancel culture is like the fact that people accept
to accept the behavior of ruining people's lives
over little shit. That's what it is.
Doesn't matter if it doesn't follow through.
It doesn't matter if you lose anything or not.
It's the fact that you think it's fucking appropriate
to call someone's fucking job and tell them and show them their Facebook
and it's like some shit they said in 2008 and get them fired over that.
That's the problem. That's it. Oh, God.
I've never heard of people like Count Dankula.
No, uninsul, the uninsuline diabeto.
I mean, how often is it that somebody says something
and oh, no, here come the Twitter mobs and here come the articles
and here come the protests and here come the news, right?
Letter writing campaigns.
Can I get this person fired?
Oh, you can't allow this person to speak here.
You can't allow this person to have a talk here.
You can't know they can't be here because they tell meany jokes
and it offends people like fuck off, Bob.
If you're going to try and let the world know that it's tonus.
That's not a real thing, guys, even though you hear about it happening.
All the fucking time, it's not real.
It's just it's just all right lies.
It doesn't happen to me.
No one takes away my honey ham.
Oh, I feel like they do these shoots, these marshmallows
that you at high speeds, they go through and he's just like, oh, die, Nazi.
Have you ever been killed by a marshmallow?
Well, to be fair, I haven't been killed by anything, I guess, but no,
I haven't been killed by a marshmallow.
All right. So anyway, he has a video.
There's a video.
The Hangover trilogy and the feature adaptation of Starsky and Hutch stated
that his making the film was inspired by traditional comedy having been killed
by, quote unquote, woke culture and laid up in the negative reviews on the far left.
So there's a certain irony in one of his films.
Most passionate defenders turning out to be left wing activist
and documentarian provocateur Michael Moore of all people.
Another person. No, no, you see, if I if I am critical
of one side of the political spectrum and somebody from that side defends my movie,
that means that my arguments bad because it's literally all are fucking nothing
in the mind of the SJW's and movie Bob.
See, Michael Moore, he liked Joker.
So that means that all of all of his criticism, it doesn't count.
Pretty sure there will be a ton of people from all over the spectrum
who like Joker because Joker is not fucking what we already know this.
But but the people who really hated it, there's a good chance
we know where they line up typically, and there's nothing wrong with hating a movie.
It's fine.
But I think the Todd was probably right.
And the whether or not Michael Moore likes the movie doesn't really take away
from his point, but all Bob said was that it's ironic for a move from fucking
Moore to be the one who Michael Moore is.
Can you guys tell me who this person is?
I know you don't want to know what a documentarian is.
Probably what he'd want to be known as.
About what? What did he make a documentary on?
Lots of different like issues in general.
He's a lefty filmmaker.
I've not actually watched any of his documentaries, so.
But he's in Team America.
Yeah, the only thing you need to know is that he's really fat.
OK, really, unfortunately, from the same.
He's he is Michael Moore.
He should be Michael less.
But I guess you did a Rex.
Yeah, fucking slid that. Yeah.
Slid that in like a side of bacon.
Slid the boom.
Grease that pig up and the Instagram after screaming of the film
at the New York Film Festival to declare that he had witnessed
a cinematic masterpiece.
Oh, how fucking painful must that be for Bob?
To have Michael Moore say that it's a masterpiece, damn.
Can you just tell us about the movie, though?
No, get the politics stuff done.
This is this is Bob.
This is probably just like the fucking way.
It's going to be halfway through.
He probably talks about the movie.
Peace and that contrary to the supposed societal dangers posed by the film,
the greater danger to society may be if you don't go to see this movie
because the story it tells and the issues it raises are so profound,
so necessary that if you look away from the genius of this work of art,
you will miss the holy shit.
Michael Moore really did like this film.
Wow, Michael Moore really did like it. Wow.
Yeah. Gift of the mirror.
It is offering us in a subsequent post more with further.
Hey, this is the team America.
Oh, my goodness.
I didn't know there was a pop in his movie, Bob.
He's like, he's so petty.
He's like, I can't do that shit on purpose.
Is it not hilarious that a fat guy is making a fat joke
about somebody else who's not as fat as him?
If he was anti-joker, I don't think Bob would have pulled this picture up,
would he? Fuck no.
But yeah, it's still pretty funny because we were just talking about the team
there is elaborate Joker makes it clear.
We don't really want to get to the bottom of this
or to try to understand why innocent people turn into jokers
after they can no longer keep it together.
No one wants to ask why two smart boys skipped their fourth hour AP
French philosophy class at Columbine.
So the act was a little loud.
Yes, it's like, yeah, OK, I'm moving away.
Fine. Hi, to slaughter 12 students and a teacher.
No one would dare ask why the son.
Oh, yeah, Mike, I'm going to cut you off right there,
because, yeah, we actually do know why the two kids at Columbine do.
Do tell us. Oh, God.
Did it because they made videos and wrote it down in journals beforehand.
The fuck is the whole that gives you the whole picture, you dumb shit.
So as evidenced by their writing, so I can't believe we're on this topic.
Holy shit. But all right.
This is a movie bar video as evidenced by their writings.
Homemade videos and other materials recovered after the 1999 Columbine massacre
shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Kelbold, were known racist
with interest in white supremacy and neo-Nazi ideology
who specifically targeted minority.
And I thought I thought Moel's point was how did they get to that point?
But. So, OK, yeah, just to clarify, right.
So Michael Moel says we need to check out Joker and take it seriously
as an example of how people become jokers.
And he referenced the Columbine Shoot is like,
how did they get to be who they were?
And then things rebuttal is they a white supremacist racist neo-Nazis.
And it's like, yeah, OK, like assuming that's true,
because I don't know anything about this, but when you want to know how that
happened. Yeah, right.
There's there's like, you know, born a Nazi, right?
I didn't I have a chance.
Oh, OK. Apparently.
Both of the killers had radically were radically different
individuals with vastly different motives and opposite mental conditions.
Hot headed, depressive, suicidal, blaming us of the problems.
It's one of those challenge.
They had a psychiatric problem.
Because I just I just googled this here
and it's it's coming up with all sorts of other stuff.
But, OK, sure.
Let me control F Nazi.
Doesn't show up.
Let me control F white.
Doesn't come up.
Well, maybe this is just a bad article.
Who knows?
I mean, I just I don't know.
Like in the spirit of the of the argument here,
I'm not even looking at the details.
I figured that Moore's point was more so.
How do these people get created in the first place? I don't know.
Yeah, it seems really weird that we're talking about this in a.
I got it. Yeah.
Anybody who's just joined the stream, this is a Joker review.
I know. It's like we haven't even talked about it.
Forgot to talk about us going on tangents.
At least I was involved. Scooby doo.
I mean, the implication here that like, well, this is what causes
they were racist, boom, don't like.
OK, so anyone like taking out mental illness,
like anyone could kill someone just because they have like radical like views,
like not everyone who has radical views, like Nazis and whatever,
is going to go out and kill.
Sometimes they're just assholes.
Sometimes they're just they just have poison.
They're just a toxic person, toxic, nonviolent person, you know, right?
We're like, it's like, oh, you're a Nazi cause of everything.
See, like, like you got to think about this show, because like,
you got you also have to think about people who read the Quran and like
and follow it to the letter and don't.
And, you know, it's like they're who are really
like repressive of the people around them because of what they believe.
But they're not violent and they're not.
They don't do go out and do crazy shit.
They're just they're just kind of assholes.
You got a whole fucking spectrum of this shit.
And I mean, you guys you guys remember back in 2017.
You guys know
the year that the last jet I came out.
Yeah, you guys remember forever.
Shall it be known?
He and he and he and four other people were shot.
Steve's cases of the US, the Republican congressman,
he was shot by a really big Bernie supporter, right?
Now that that shit right there.
Oh, man.
I bet a lot of you don't remember that happened.
But remember that that did happen.
But oh, if it just whatever it seems like, one of the sides do it.
It's always downplayed.
Hush, hush. Don't talk about it.
It's not a big deal. Don't worry about it.
But man, we got to dig up every little thing we can get on the other side.
It's just just some just some like this.
But I don't forget.
The problem is, this is weird to bring up in a fucking Joker video.
Yeah. And you might be like, what do you mean?
He had to because Michael Moore did.
It's like you brought up Michael Moore.
Like why?
Movie Bob is like super political and everything is through
the lens of social justice and class warfare and eugenics and shit like that.
So Movie Bob has got to find a way to like this.
We've got to find a way to put his ideology
into all this stuff that he does, and if it's a movie review,
got to find a way to use everything in that description.
You just gave him this dude as to why Joker is a good film.
I mean, he's got a pander.
He's got a following to pander to this one.
I got to show everyone that Nazis are bad.
It's like, yeah, we know, but there are a Nazi.
I mean, you could very he could very easily push the narrative.
White man bad with.
Oh, my God, Thomas Wayne.
And look what the rich white man did to the poor guy
that had mental illness and look what it did and look how it just destroys society.
We need to, you know, destroy the patriarchy and all the white men.
He could totally use that narrative as being a positive for this, but he doesn't.
Yeah, but the Joker wasn't black, though.
He wasn't female. So I can count.
Genuinely, if the Joker was black, the discourse would be completely different.
Oh, absolutely.
It would be insane.
You can't just you can't just flip a flip a race like that.
And I have haven't mean the same thing.
It should. It should. Right.
But it not anymore.
Everything's got to be, dare I say it, colored in something that's
it's deep and symbolic or it.
Things can't just be what they are. Right.
So is he offended that the.
You know, black.
Well, well, this is well, in the first video that we covered from movie, Bob,
he was talking about Joker.
He said that basically all of all of the white male problems
that Arthur has in the film are the result of a woman. Right.
It's like the film was essentially saying that the cause of all your problems
are it's all because of a woman. Right.
It's just these wild, wild takes like how T.Y.T.
said that, you know, Joker has a problem with black women. Right.
They just these insane, huge galaxy brain level takes that you just can't.
You wouldn't have even thought of.
They wouldn't have entered into your mind at all.
But they just they just pull them out.
And I think one of the reasons why a lot of especially left
leaning people seem to not like the Joker. Right.
Is because the Joker skirts really close to that line.
Talking about the richer evil and normal people are just are oppressed.
And it just pushes that.
And there's nothing bad about the other side. Right.
Joker teaches us that misunderstandings come from both sides and that
even if you're if you're on the bottom, you're on the top,
no matter which side of the economic ladder you're on, not ladder,
which scale you're on things, you know, you can take things too far
and you can do bad stuff and just, you know,
not everything is excused because of, you know, that kind of situation.
But the movie very easily could have been changed
to where it clearly portrayed one side as being the bad guys.
And the other side is obviously being totally the victims.
And I think that they're kind of resentful of the fact that it didn't do that.
That Joker could have been a very, very popular film
that portrayed the kind of thing that they wanted to see, but it didn't.
And so you end up with reviews when they talk about Michael Moore.
Right. All right.
But I mean, it's Bob's take the there's nothing to say about this film.
So like, I guess this is tying into the idea that he's just like,
I mean, I'm just just talking about what I can
because it's just this film's nothing bigger.
But, you know, I guess he's like cherry picking to make his point,
which doesn't make sense.
I mean, he hyper targeted.
Like I said, this is just inappropriate, but, you know, fine.
This is what he wants to talk about.
I guess what happens next?
Can in the irony of him and the irony of the second paragraph here,
subsequently also ignored by Michael Moore's film Bowling for Columbine,
which instead redirected focus to the political and economic issues
that are the focus of most of Moore's other films.
Jeez, no self-awareness there, Bob.
Oh, I know who this person is now.
The bowling for something movies. Yeah.
I never watched them, but I know the cover.
Chris.
I'm waiting for it to continue, but anyway,
the fact that I was overwhelmingly certain that Joker was not, in fact,
about the things Michael Moore was describing to it in any meaningful way.
Oh, so Mr.
Subjective just said someone else's meaning they drew out of it isn't actually there.
Strong.
I like this is this is part I get really fascinated
because we lay out this sort of framework and they they'll come out
as with like not fucking nonsense.
It's all subjective.
You cannot deny someone else's experience in the same fucking breath.
You have people like Movie Bobby and like the film isn't remotely
about what he thinks it's about.
It's like, oh, OK, interesting.
Yeah, simple as that, man.
It really bothers me.
So fucking hypocritical, but all right.
Because he said it with any in any meaningful way as well.
Like, I'm sorry, you can just define the amount of meaning is in a thing now.
Sure.
In fact, about the things Michael Moore was describing to it in any meaningful way.
Those of you who've seen my review of the film, of course, know that I was not a fan.
For me, only served to highlight one of its most curious qualities,
that it's a film comprised almost entirely of surface level texture, aesthetics,
visual cues, needle drops, soundtrack, auditory, mood notes,
allusions to contemporary social topics and politics,
but with all of them decoupled from any inherent meaning
that they typically possess, and none of it unified by any cohesive theme.
That was a long sentence.
So good.
He's talking to me so long.
He's going to be again.
Again, if breathing wasn't a reflex, people like him would be dead.
What the fuck are you making me watch?
Look, he I'm trying to think about how I can condense this for him.
So every element of the filmmaking
that's not the writing, but also including the references to political question mark,
like stuff, I don't know, all of it isn't tied together in any meaningful way.
I think that's what he said.
Oh, sweetie, does all by the way, surface level texture, duh.
Oh, you mean, yeah.
But I also I just find it amusing because like it's kind of how I feel about TLJ.
I'm like, oh, yeah, it's pretty much all surface.
But he would be like, no, the three years.
I guess it's just the fact that Joker, it's just so simple.
Really, it's offensively simple rags, offensively simple.
It's like, how come everyone gets this, but the galaxy brains on YouTube?
How did this guy become popular?
Like, what was the video that did it that maybe he got in or not even convinced
we can classify him as popular anymore?
Like, what kind of view count does he get on these videos?
Let's have a look.
Let me take a look.
Like, people are subscribed to this guy and listen and watch his content.
And this is 61K views, and he's sharing the platform with Yahtzee.
Yeah, this is escapist.
So he's on a channel with one point one five subs, but.
Hmm.
What about his channel?
Does he have a channel?
Yeah, he does. OK.
Hmm.
He's my brain already.
He's pulling between 10 and 15K on each video.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is evidence of him.
He got in early.
I think he sank in popularity.
So I'm pretty sure he's more popular than that once upon a time.
His last video is.
Martin's Martin Scorsese versus himself.
Let's stop talking about real cinema.
Seven hours, 11000 views, so.
Hmm.
Oh, wait, he made a seven hour video.
I think it's less so that he's super popular.
Mostly, he just never goes away.
He's like the creature of the Internet that was and he never changed.
Like a cockroach.
How many times he comes back?
Yeah, I was going to say that you have to like just cut their head off
and like destroy it and then they still grow another head.
Because he's been making videos that look exactly like this for a long time,
like as long as I can even remember it being on the Internet.
He hasn't evolved like at all.
He's learning nothing critic.
Well, he's like he's the quintessential example of being stuck,
being caked inside your own point of view where you can't possibly
fucking evolve in any way that's actually that's actually cake.
He's trapped in cake.
Oh, I thought it was gelatinous cube.
He is meaning in the Last Jedi, but he doesn't find any meaning in the Joker.
Are you fucking shitting me?
Yeah, that's the crazy.
Well, this is the thing.
Like we have this fascinating arc on our show where we have to deal
with all the stuff.
Now again, so many of the regulars who love TLJ not getting Joker.
And it's like, what happened to you guys?
Like, why, why didn't you use that shovel that you used to dig
30 feet down into the dirt to just squeeze those themes
out of the Last Jedi and twist that film into trying to be meaningful
and to make sense?
Oh, we can do that.
No problem.
But with all these stuff like Joker, they can't do it.
Yeah, TLJ was made by a fat neck idiot for fat neck idiots like this,
like capital, like, like, because I guess like there's certain themes
in that movie that aligns with their their political beliefs.
And I guess that's all they need to like for that to be a good movie.
Well, capitalism, bad, you can't tell by bullshit.
That shit is all I mean.
Failure is the greatest teacher.
OK, it just seems like with the Last Jedi is everything.
It's just like it's so shoved down your throat in your face.
Like capitalism, bad animal rights.
Let's abandon the orphans.
But with the Joker, it's like this guy has a hard life.
He has a hard day.
He goes to work.
He comes home. He takes care of his mom.
He doesn't get to do the things that he wants to do.
And then finally, when he does, it's all the bad stuff.
And it's like this guy just had a bad day after a bad day after a bad day.
And he had to work hard and nothing paid off.
Nothing was handed to him like how it was with Ray, like it was with Rose, like Finn.
Everything just gets handed to those people.
Even when shit doesn't go right for them, they still end out on top.
Whereas Joker, he ends out on top.
But, you know, the world's burning around them.
And I think all these people, they just haven't had a hard day.
They just don't understand the concept of shit gets bad sometimes.
And you have to deal with it like a fucking grown up.
And they don't understand that.
And it blows my mind how stupid and naive people are about real life issues.
Genuinely, why we have trouble
associating with characters that don't experience any trouble.
We're all just sitting there like, wow, that must have been nice.
It blows my fucking mind how just people like this exist.
Oh, anyway,
it was difficult to get over that sentence.
Bob, fire the next one at us and unified by any cohesive theme.
In other words, a movie that in certain key points looks or feels
like it has something to say or might even be about something.
But in fact, what a joke is not about anything.
What? Oh,
I like how he said it might be about something like, wow.
So generous, Bob, it's about nothing.
Oh, my God.
This guy, Bobber, had to struggle with it.
Could you imagine movie Bob trying to do what the Joker did running after those
kids, what he would probably know?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You actually have to stop as soon as you say the word running.
I was going to say, be on his little scooter.
He'd be like, stop right there.
Imagine him rolling, maybe.
You have leg privilege.
Oh, my God.
Can you imagine Bob rolling like like the one of those stupid things
in the prequels called the droids that roll?
Oh, droids all destroyers.
Oh, yeah, the droids.
Yeah. Like, could you imagine if he was rolling around like a droideca
after after the kid?
See, I was picturing him on the scooter
because the kids then shove the side into the wheel of the scooter
and it cracks and just falls over.
He's like, oh, no, and tilts until he falls.
And then the camera pans out and he's just on the floor crying.
Why? I'm sorry.
I'm just imagining that instead of Joker, it's just Bob.
The only thing in my head is like movie Bob, like seeing people steal his things.
And then he like folds up and starts rolling after them
with the Terminator theme in the background.
If your heart is breaking, eat.
Even though your arm is quaking.
When you're ordering, I feel like maybe he would like this movie.
If we if we get it made.
What do you say, Bob?
We're not exactly interested in funding it,
but we support you funding it.
I want to see Robert do it. Come on.
And then in the trailer, you have like Morgan Freeman
or some just famous voice being like, what makes a man a movie, Bob?
Morgan Freeman narrating movie Bob's life.
It could be just like can be just like March of the Penguins,
but with a lot more fat March of the Bob
Oh, March of the Bobins.
We get baby. Bob drinks his
Bob drinks his coffee with Twizzlers.
I'm not one to judge.
Oh, my God.
Maybe you should lay off the sugar, Bob.
I can imagine Morgan Freeman
just having a snarky ass commentary over the whole thing.
No, it reminds me.
Did you guys watch The Office?
Uh, yeah, but Steve, girl.
I've seen a couple of episodes.
I haven't seen the whole thing.
Oh, you haven't.
Come on, guys.
There's this one episode where he it's a continuous thing
that he's been filming his like secret agent movie for like 11 years.
So on the last season that he's on it, he finally is showing everyone the movie.
And so he has the black guy in The Office narrating it.
And so at the end, it shows that it's, you know, him
and he has his hair all dyed white and he's just, you know,
kind of mouthing what the black guy's narration is.
And he's like, oh, this is why I know so much about this character,
because I am him.
And so I'm just picturing movie Bob sitting there with Morgan Freeman's voice.
And then it turns around and it's movie Bob just mouthing
while Morgan's famous voice is coming out of his body.
Oh, you have to watch the episode to understand this reference.
I I do want to watch The Office.
I only hear good things about it.
It's very good.
You should watch it before it gets taken off Netflix.
Wait, is your Netflix the same?
Do you even have that one?
Oh, yeah, I guess Netflix changes based on region, right?
So maybe. Yes.
I found out that Pirate Bay, Pirate Bay, Pirate Bay subverts
your expectations all day.
Pirate Bay is great.
I would never suggest anyone partake in those disgusting,
in a dishonorable thievery.
That is the power of never tell people to never.
Sharing, sharing is carrying rags.
Would never I would I disavow.
Sharing is carrying pirate.
I got to cover us legally.
I mean, by that logic, if you borrow a DVD from your friend
or they give it to you because they got another copy that's stealing the movie.
You wouldn't download the same shit.
You wouldn't download a baby, would you?
Yeah, I do all the time on Sims, Mahler.
I load babies down into the garbage disposal.
You occasionally sounds like it's saying something, but then isn't fully
get at what I'm saying requires describing basically the plot of them.
You know, it would be really useful for Bob
if instead of just saying it doesn't say anything, it doesn't say anything.
He's like, here's what people say.
Here's why the movie doesn't have anything to do with that.
Or the movie isn't giving this message.
He hasn't really explained any of his points yet.
He's just made declarations without giving any context to it.
Well, this is kind of what we get out when we're like, yeah, these
these videos are under fucking 20 minutes.
Sure. And the way the dreaded long.
And so you don't want to do anything longer than that.
But she doesn't fucking say anything yet.
We're still waiting.
Like was. Oh, yeah.
Me and Rags watched a high tops video on Endgame.
I actually agree with the majority of his points in it.
Holy shit. He can take a while to get to saying stuff.
Yeah, he's editing shit, too.
But I mean, well, do you mean script editing or video editing?
No, no, you know, the noises and the audio and the pacing.
See, I'll give you that.
That sound is annoying as hell.
But I think it's video editing.
I want to I want to say his video editing is pretty good
compared to what you usually get, which is like on a technical level.
Sure. But it's like the decision making of how to edit the video is awful.
Just high top.
Stop using those warm sounds, please.
I beg you. Less is less is more.
Anyway, back to Bobbitt.
Being something but then isn't to fully get at what I'm saying
requires describing basically the plot of the film and its major events.
So as quickly as possible, bullshit.
Oh, Jesus Christ, dude.
This is a plot of Joker.
You were lower the side of the ping.
The sound of the ping.
You were warned.
But the beginning of this video, this is dangerous video territory.
You were warned. OK.
You were warned.
This version of the Joker starts out as a guy named Arthur Fleck,
who is poor and miserable because he suffers from a neurological condition
of initially unknown origin that causes him to suffer a fits of uncontrolled
laughing in inappropriate situations.
He lives alone in an economically stagnant 1980s.
He does a little, but he's got any fucked it up.
He lives.
Is he about to say he lives alone with his mother?
Is that what he's about to say here?
He lives alone with because he's got a picture of like the mom,
you know, from Seymour's mom, which is comparable.
So he knows condition of initially unknown origin
that causes him to suffer a fits of uncontrolled laughing in inappropriate situations.
He lives alone in an economically stagnant 1980s Gotham City
with his ailing mother works part time.
Yeah, there it is.
How do you live alone with his mother?
How do you say that?
He actually said it's automatically correct to say that two people can live alone.
I don't think so.
The mothers aren't people.
Oh, shit, sorry.
It's a single bomb.
I can't believe it.
Wow, you devaluing motherhood.
That's disgusting.
You're not the feminist.
That's not what a feminist looks like, Bob.
Yeah.
Or maybe he's just saying women in general don't count as people.
And so therefore any man that lives with a woman lives alone.
I'll meet him halfway and we'll say that they count as three fifths of a person.
Three fifths?
Can we? Yeah, we agreed.
But still, that would mean it's a good compromise.
Yeah, I think it's a good compromise.
And just to clarify, how many people does Bob count as?
Is it 17 or?
He counts as six fifths of a person.
Six fifths.
Yes, he's definitely six.
He can count the turkey under my kitties.
Six fifths.
That's my snack holder.
What, your hand, Bob?
No.
How dare you refer to it that way?
It's my right hand is not called hand.
It's called Maurice.
Oh, see, that's cultured.
That is cultured.
Mm hmm. Oh, he lives alone with his mother.
This is Mr. Eugenics.
Thank you so much.
Oh, yeah, a lot of people keep repeating that.
I don't know if this is just known, is it that he either used to or is
in his mother's basement, like unironically, is that his like thing?
Really?
People repeat it a lot.
And I don't know if it's true because well, I hope it's true.
I hope it's true.
Bob would consider that virtuous and noble and you can't understand he just
he's too busy making this this incredibly intellectually stimulating, deep content.
He can't hold down a normal crappy job like the rest of his mortals can.
He has to do important things like make movie.
I don't know if he gets enough of a view count to be able to live in like it.
And well, if he's with a mother's basement, it's not going to be that expensive.
What about does he have a Patreon or something?
I think somebody said he does.
And it's really sad to look at.
Oh, oh, let's do it, then.
Movie, but my mom lives with me.
Women are awesome.
I would go absolutely insane if I had to live with my mother still.
That would actually make a bit of sense.
Like he really wants to tell people that he lives alone.
So he just pretends to live with his mother.
So he just pretends that his mom isn't a person.
Oh, wow, dude, he can check that out to his video a month.
Yes, that's all.
I didn't expect that 3600 from Patreon a month.
All right, Bob, that should be when you said when you said sad,
I thought it was going to be something like, yes, it's the other kind of sad.
That's not that's not sad.
That's really disappointing when people said Patreon.
And I was like, oh, OK, is Patreon sad?
Meaning it probably like one dollar a month type of thing.
But thirty six hundred dollars a month.
What? I mean, sometimes people need to be told the Joker doesn't mean anything.
Are you telling me that people willingly give Bob
sixteen hundred dollars more actually?
No, more like two thousand dollars more a month than I make working
40 hours a week.
Dude, have you a lot of stupid people have wallets?
A different job.
Have you put out a video saying Joker's meaningless?
No, I guess not.
Yeah, get falling like movie movie fit.
How could you say that, Chris?
Anyway, so movie Bob thinks that Joker lives alone with his mom.
All right. Good, good stuff.
Lives alone in an economically stagnant 1980s Gotham City
with his ailing mother, works part time as a clown and dreams of becoming
a stand up comedian and performing on the locally recorded Murray Franklin
late night talk show during a particularly bad series of events.
Arthur shoots and kills three mean drunken investment bankers
from Wayne Enterprises Corporation who are bullying him on the subway,
which seems to trigger the beginning of a psychotic break
and gives him the confidence to pursue a romantic relationship with his
pretty psychotic break.
Yeah, if anything, this sort of coincides with a lot of other things happening.
One of those things being of the lack of availability of his medication.
Yeah, there's a couple of things that happen at once.
Yeah, it's not a thing, right?
There's a lot of stuff going on at once.
His mother's situation, it's his work situation.
People just don't understand that it's more than one thing.
It's like a little thing and a little thing and a little thing.
They all add up to, you know, this one big thing that makes you explode.
You know, like a normal person.
You know, nobody just loses it on one thing.
Well, maybe if that one thing is like a huge thing to happen.
But it's just he's having a bad day.
One thing happens on this day.
Another thing happens on this day.
And it's like things add up.
How do you not understand that?
That's a normal thing that happens in real life, you know.
Yeah.
Wolf, you probably remember this better than I do.
What happens first?
Him imagining that she comes to his apartment or him killing the people on the subway?
Say it one more time.
I think she comes to his apartment first, right?
But what I'm trying to figure out is, did he imagine the relationship with?
No, no, no, no, it had to be first because it had to be first.
Because he he follows her to work.
And then it's shortly after that that she comes to his apartment.
And it's immediately after killing the guys on the subway
that he pretends that he walked into her apartment and started kissing.
And makes it happen there for his psychotic break,
if you're going to call it that, for imagining who happened
actually before the subway, not after the subway.
All right.
Just clarifying there with Bob, it he seems to have a different opinion.
You know, it's not that it's provably wrong.
It's a different opinion, which seems to trigger
the beginning of a psychotic break and gives him the confidence
to pursue a romantic relationship with his pretty neighbor,
because Arthur was wearing his clown makeup at the time.
It also creates an urban legend of an anti-greed killer clown vigilante
hunting down Gotham's one percent, which inspires billionaire Thomas Wayne
to run for mayor on a law and order platform and in turn inspires
an underclass revolution clown mask protest movement.
Arthur subsequently learns that he's running for mayor before that.
I was actually about to ask, was he announced for mayor
before the subway killings?
Yeah, because they ask him in an interview about like the clown, right?
The clown thing happened.
They start wearing the clown masks and everything
because he calls him a bunch of clowns.
Yeah, which, yeah,
because the night that he gets the gun and he accidentally shoots the wall,
him and his mom were watching Thomas Wayne on TV.
Remember, she's saying, oh, you know, he's such a nice man.
He's going to help us. And he's like, no, he's not.
Like why do you care so much?
Yeah, I think that's right.
Damn, not even getting it.
So just to clarify, people give us shit for doing too much.
Like, oh, they just recant the plot.
It's like, at least we can.
I didn't realize it was such a hard ability, but, you know, getting there.
His mother used to work for Thomas Wayne had an affair with him
and that Arthur is actually Wayne's illegitimate son.
But when he confronts, oh, OK, dude,
if I've been doing so much information,
geez, if I had been doing this for this long, oh, my God,
don't you like improve over time?
Most people improve over time.
Well, this is the thing I'm not going to say he's like Godwares.
It's just he's stayed exactly the same.
This video could have been made in 2006.
I wouldn't be proud of it personally, but hey,
salting the videos made in 2000.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Video creators of 2006. I didn't mean that.
That's insulting to the guy who made the first YouTube video
where he was like, hey, guys, at the zoo.
Yeah, bye.
And just he I don't understand his train of thought.
He thinks that this entire thing is just about this or is I mean,
well, I guess Joker didn't even care about Thomas Wayne
until he finds out that information, but he's he's just doing other stuff in life.
And then this just happens kind of on accident.
You know, he's dealing with work, getting fired, having the relationship,
you know, trying to be a comedian.
And then because his mom, it's just like that little annoying thing
that's happening in the background with his mom.
Oh, check the mail, check the mail.
Did he write? Did he write?
And then he reads the letter.
He's like, oh, shit, is this true?
Then he starts pursuing it because he has nothing left.
So why is it?
Is he a fair 100 percent?
I thought that I thought of the idea was that you could only infer
that it might have happened, the affair.
Yeah, I think after that, he has the whole trip to the trip
to the balloon he been there, they have all the records of all patients
and everything like that.
So I think they kind of really stress that she's not telling the truth.
That's the impression I got.
Well, she's not lying intentionally.
Right. Like her maliciously rather.
She's not repenting the truth.
Oh, apparently Sog on is in chat.
I can't see him, but people want me to know that.
All right. Hello.
You must be in six week every movie, Bob.
I'm sorry, he's a disaster anyway.
Wayne and the actual records about this, it turns out that Arthur's mother
was severely mentally ill, hallucinated her relationship, adopted.
He did the other upside down.
That's mental illness.
That's mental illness, I know it.
But Arthur, to make her fantasy feel more real and then neglected him,
being violently abused by her real partners, causing the injuries
that led to his neurological damage.
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
He stopped using these sound effects like you're never left 2010.
Christ, this is it's trying to tell a story, but giving absolutely no context.
It's like, come on.
He even left out the part where he goes to the house and messes with Bruce
and then meets Alfred and then goes and confronts Thomas Wayne,
then finds out all the information about his mom.
And it's all these stepping stones onto his descent into madness.
It's like, how are you just leaving out all of this fucking information?
Or do you not? Are you that dense?
Do you not understand this movie?
Like, I feel like this is one of those things where
have you ever watched a movie with a kid and like every two seconds, like why?
Why they do that? What's that? What's that?
And they ask you like 10 million questions.
I feel like that's what it would be like watching a movie with him.
It's like you have to explain every five seconds what's going on
because he just doesn't understand it.
I also find it pretty.
I don't I don't even know what feeling describes it exactly.
But he's like this person was beaten as the child to the point
where they have mental damage as an adult.
And then he puts one after it.
And it's like, oh, OK, like, yeah.
Mocking that up before damage.
That's kind of funny.
Apparently he doesn't think that child abuse is a thing to talk about.
He thinks it's funny.
All right. That's what he's going for.
He's like, wow, wow.
Oh, children get abused.
Oh, well, they're white. It doesn't matter.
Yeah, we can laugh at it in a movie.
Oh.
He also realizes that he himself has been similarly hallucinating
the romance with his neighbor and learns that Murray Franklin
has used a video clip of him bombing at an open like comedy night
as the subject of the show out of order again.
Well, he doesn't realize
or we don't know if he knew it the entire time or not, but that's after.
That is so fucking far after he sees his little thing on the TV.
His mom has a fucking stroke because he goes off on her.
Then she's in the hospital.
Then he's watching the TV.
Then he sees the thing.
And then he gets the call from the people.
But that. Oh, my God, timeline is fucked up.
It's it's hard to recall the movie.
OK. Movie Bob's trying.
I have seen this movie once the night it came out, which was what?
Two months ago now.
And it would. Oh, oh, oh, it's making me mad.
It's OK. It's OK.
He'll make you even more mad soon, probably.
My head hurts.
I'm going to go get Excedrin. I will be right back.
He has that power.
Yeah. People's heads hurt.
They've made memes about how many people he's killed.
I believe he killed Jay Longbun before, right?
You were on you left while we were covering him at some point.
I think it was the 50.
Mm hmm.
He killed you. How do you feel?
You got resurrected.
He killed me. Wait, what?
Whatever. If ever anyone leaves while we're covering a movie, Bob video,
it means he killed you.
Oh, OK. Yeah, OK.
Yeah, he did. How about that?
He killed me before we even started the video.
Yep. Well, that's that's Star Wars Wars girl.
Like I got a headache and I had to let I'm bouncing.
That that was the thing is like the
the last time that I that are the only other time that I watched a movie Bob video,
it gave me a headache so bad that I had to leave the show.
Naturally, I mean,
out of just said she's getting something for a headache.
So, you know, it's only a matter of time.
Just the idea is to not dose yourself too high of a movie Bob at a time.
You just got to take it easy.
The identity of the job, create your jobs, create a supersonic sonic wave.
Yeah. It's migraine.
I mean, I just don't understand because I mean, all of us make videos, right?
So there's always those people that comments like you said this wrong
on this part of your video at this second.
And it's like, holy fucking shit, I pronounced a name wrong.
Oh, my God. I mean, embodiment of evil.
But it's like, if people just do that, you know, our videos, it's like,
what do people do when they watch movie, Bob?
It's like, bro, you you're not even getting the chain of events correct.
Like, won't people just destroy him in the comments of this?
Well, because it only met the messages ahead.
Does he is he one of those people that censors his comments?
I'm going to assume not.
Have you ever tried reading comments?
I'm going to where's the link to this actual video?
I want to go read the comments and see if anyone called him out
on how stupid this shit is.
Well, is bottom right is in the little thing you can see.
Bottom right of what?
Watch together. It'll have the video and you can click that
and it'll take you to the actual one.
But yeah, he's he's been
he's been he's been called out before.
I think he like I said,
people don't really like him on the escapist because he's terrible.
So like he's so they got their normal escapist.
They got their normal escapist content that is just like.
Oh, no. What?
Oh, no. What? What is it?
Is he going to pay something in a moment?
It's going to give us context.
I'm excited. He's wearing a candy corn KKK hat.
Diabeto.
You get some. Oh, you can see his man titties.
Oh, no.
Oh, he's he's going to be stretching them if he puts all that way.
Oh, the careful Bob.
You only get one set.
Oh, candy corn helmet.
I guess something big old.
Just shakes and doughnuts and cubes.
Anyway, wasn't one of them when he shakes?
Bringing you up here as a guest on the Franklin show with the aim of committing
an on air suicide, but he is instead riled up by the surprisingly
positive reaction of the audience and an outside mob of clown
masked protesters to his off the cuff rant against the madness of society
that he murders Murray instead.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
He skipped. He skipped the movie.
He skipped like 45 minutes of the fucking movie.
It's finally is going. It's fine.
He's doing it because this movie means nothing.
It's the company with his coworkers.
He missed the whole entire thing about how that he's running away from the cops
because the cops came to the hospital and talked to him about his mom
because they're they think that he, you know, is the guy that shot the people.
They skip the entire part about him and, you know, his old coworkers coming,
the sleazy guy that betrayed him and then a little midget guy.
And it shows that he actually, you know, even though he's going to kill people,
he still has morals because he's like, oh, you are the only one in this entire
you know, movie that was nice to me and I had to make up other people
that were nice to me and just how how did he miss this?
How did he go from this and leave out all the information between,
you know, this event to this next event and the thought about killing himself
and then leaving out all the little information that's in his journal.
He left out the whole entire thing about not being on his meds anymore
and the psychiatrist and how?
Because that's how you plot summarize, you ignore the plot.
I want to have somebody listen to a movie Bob video and then I want to go.
All right. So tell me about it.
What happened?
Well, what happened?
What what what was movie Bob's main point here?
Well, what was I mean, all I've got to worry so far is Columbine.
That's it. I'm like, oh, yeah, that happened.
Tell me what you learned from watching that movie, Bob video.
That he cherry picks.
He leaves out so much information.
This is this is the example of, you know, when you were in like English class
and you had to read the book and then you had to have a discussion
with the rest of the class and you know, right.
You read the synopsis and that was it.
Yeah, that's that's what this is.
He read some of the points.
He read a really bad, you know, little spark notes version of somebody
that also read a spark notes version and he's getting like fourth hand information.
And that's why he doesn't understand this movie.
I don't think he's seen it.
I mean, it's not even because we're on the part
where he's going to start making statements about the film.
Like this is where it's going to get really bad, probably.
Oh, boy, police cruiser taking him to jail is destroyed
and Arthur himself is rescued and revived by the army of clowns
now destroying the city.
The Joker strikes a triumphant pose as not far away.
One of his self-declared minions stalks the Wayne family into an alley
and shoots Thomas and Martha dead so that Bruce can begin his journey
toward becoming Robert Pattinson like two years from now.
Oh, my God, that's not even right.
The Robert Pattinson movie is not even connected to the Joker movie.
And so it's OK.
We can just assume that was a joke.
We'll just assume it was.
Yes, it's all videos.
This guy doesn't seem smart enough to understand that type of humor.
Well, how else can we deal with this?
I'm sorry.
He's trying to he's trying to explain ending of this movie
in like a mocking fashion like this is actually how they ended.
I'm like, no, but tell me what the problems are.
But that's not how it ends.
Well, I did say he's trying.
He was going to talk about the movie halfway through.
Like I was wrong about that, but he hasn't actually said anything yet.
They did it. They did it.
Oh, my goodness.
We even have to do the deed, the deed, the deed for Peter's diet.
Feel. Oh, my God.
I like that his lips hanged out as he floats along
because they're in incredible weight and his inability to physically lift them.
Yes. Yeah.
Remember when he goes to the people in the spaceship
and like their bones are all shrunk because they're all like just floating.
They're all super fat.
I feel like movie is from that generation of humans.
Movie Bob is in one confirmed.
I'm doing saying that he's an advanced human.
No, no, they're not advanced.
The ship does everything for them.
Remember the pilot has to, you know, go above the computer to figure it out.
You're just jealous.
This is peak humanity.
Literally, the only thing I remember from Wally is at the end of the movie,
one of the fat people was like, let's plant pizza plants.
Well, which is not a bad idea.
Yeah. If I could have a pizza tree, I would plant one.
I would, too, if that existed.
You know, I think there's a cheap for that on Sims.
There you go.
But let's be honest.
Well, if you would plant the shit out of that.
Yeah, you'd plant that pizza tree.
Well, that's why I remember.
Well, yeah, actually, yeah, that's fair.
Anyway, let's say this is coming in good this year.
Let's do it, Bob.
We're going to have pizzas all winter.
Oh, thanks for taking me to the movies in this dangerous neighborhood, Dad.
Oh, stop. You can't go to this.
This is Teen Titans, right?
Oh, oh, my God.
You're about to call them the orange show.
Oh, Teen Titans.
Go right.
How dare you use the oh,
the only super cool show.
The only thing that's worse than this is so the Titans show.
Which one?
No, the new one where the life is like fat and black.
Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.
It's just like at least make her fucking orange.
I don't care if it's a black actress, but just make her orange.
You can go find, you know, black cosplay
girls that do like the most legit starfire cosplay.
And they just did that.
It's like, come on, orange, tight and bad.
Oh, as you might have now surmised, there are a lot of different angles
from which to point out that this movie is extremely dumb.
What?
I'm a bomb.
Even with what even with what he described, what was dub about it?
On the alley, it's a double attack.
Oh, my God.
But I just want to have a conversation.
I want to I just want to ask him how he's getting from point A to point B
because it just it's not.
It's just dumb.
It just it just.
Oh, my head.
You don't understand because you're dumb.
Different angles from which to point out that this movie is extremely dumb
in a way that makes the self-seriousness, which it takes itself
particularly bad approach.
The wrong note, the loudest key all the way.
I think I might break.
It's happening again.
My head is starting to hurt.
OK, everything that he just said about Joker.
I'm going to roll that on reverse to his video.
OK, dude, your video is dumb.
There's no substance to anything that you just said
because you provide absolutely no context.
All of the examples that you use are wrong and you don't get them right.
It just my head, my head hurts.
We were halfway through the video.
Yeah, we're making it like no.
Absolutely.
Well, I'm just I just want to say that I like how movie Bob's visual style
of putting shit all over the screen is so reminiscent of Brett Keane.
He's going for the pop art aesthetic, but I don't know why.
Oh, this is like Brett's like child.
Imagine so.
I don't know which one is
which one came first in like the ancient law books.
I don't know. I don't know how to decide.
Yeah, it's hard to tell how old Brett is because he looks like he's 60,
but I guess he's only like 40.
It's true.
There are a lot of different angles from which to point out that this movie
is extremely dumb in a way that makes the self seriousness, which it takes itself
particularly bad approach.
I'm sure the rigor that he would explain to us, the plot and consistencies
of the Joker would be the exact same rigor that he would use to explain
how the last guy makes.
I don't even think he would go with points.
He's just going to focus entirely on the fact there's no meaning in the film.
I guess I'm entirely subjective anyway.
Like, what does everything mean to you?
He's already taken away from ball.
I would love to hear him like actually start to say things,
like explain things in an object.
This is why objectivity is very important.
We make claims like show evidence for something that you think.
Explain to us stuff that's happening and things.
Tell us things, right?
Tell us why they're good, why they're bad.
Give a substance to pick apart.
He has just made statements.
He hasn't defended any of his points.
He's like, oh, well, this this and this happen.
The Joker is a dumb movie.
It's like, what?
It's a meanie. It's a movie.
Nothing happens. There's no meaning in it.
It's empty.
I want to because someone made a meme that's got Black Panther is alt right
because it's anti-immigration, isolation, isolationist, pro-wool,
strict trade restrictions, anti-diversity and ethno-nationalist.
And Bob has retweeted the picture and said, hey, probably a good idea
for you to watch the movie first.
It's like, oh, funny coming from you, buddy.
I don't know.
Whoa, and a non-meme, but very nice note.
Here's a thing that's in the works.
Apparently, like a puppy.
One moment to make it a pop out rags.
Yeah, that's amazing.
You got a little tongue.
That's incredible.
So you can you can find them out.
You're still fluffy.
Yes, it's very fluffy.
It's like a little cloud around back there.
Oh, that's really cool.
How someone's making a little.
So I guess you could you could print it out on paper and you could fold it up
and you could put you put me on your desk so I can always stare at you
and look at you and advise you when you make a bad argument.
Yeah, absolutely.
Yes. Oh, oh, oh, right.
That had like your catchphrases, like every your secrets.
Oh, when you said hi rags and it said hello, that'd be cute.
Oh, my God.
You press a button and says hello.
Well, and if happens, you're going to want to keep an eye on
you to see what every day is going to bring.
If this is this is a one.
Is this like they actually make one and that's a picture or is it?
I don't know.
I don't know how deep this goes.
I don't know what the dealio is here is a really cool project idea.
That's incredible.
Wonder if they'll have a long man or a wolf or pizza.
Oh, maybe.
That is so cute.
That is adorable.
It's hard to believe that we have to go from this back to movie, Bob.
Yeah.
Sorry about that, guys.
Obviously, I don't need to do this to you.
Worlds.
I don't mean to torment you, folks.
Dumb in a way that makes the self seriousness, which it takes itself particularly bad approach.
The wrong notes played in the loudest key all the way through.
You could literally start your what the hell went wrong with.
No, no, just pick one.
Just please.
Just pick one.
All of the things are wrong.
Which one?
Oh, tell us why.
Please, Bob, this is a problem.
Tell us why something not just that it is going to do it.
I'm sure that Joker doctoral analysis in 100 different ways and made all lead to the same
breakdown.
But since I don't have all day, I'll use the one that jumps.
I think we had a are we on 540 on 542.
Yeah.
All right.
Let me roll it back.
My thing here.
So we're not even halfway through.
It's OK.
It's OK.
We can do this if we just stick together teamwork.
Teamwork makes the dream work halfway through.
We're halfway through.
We are.
Oh, yeah, I'm looking at a wrong number.
I saw the 42 and thought it was a 42 minute video.
Oh, God.
No.
God, Jesus.
All three different ways and all lead to the same breakdown.
But since I don't have all day, I'll use the one that comes out of me.
42 43.
Oh, I think you're mostly in sync.
You should be right.
OK.
All right.
Why does this movie take place in the 1980s?
Rags, would you like to field that question?
Why does this take place in the 1980s?
Well, there are some budget cuts in the 1980s that were in that were like mental
health stuff.
So that was probably a good parallel there.
Yeah.
It's to do with Reagan, right?
Yeah.
Some some cuts that were made to like mental health and stuff like that.
So that's probably one reason.
I happen to think that another reason is the the lower security elements,
the the ease of the crimes being committed.
I think cell phones, the talk show stuff.
A lot of this could take place in modern time.
Sure.
But yeah, I think it lends itself to isolation.
This is a lot easier with with the lack of any kind of easy contact being set that far
away, but like then we have the ultimate question once we give all of those reasons,
we're like, why do you why does it matter?
Like, what's the problem?
Batman outfit looking good.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, this reminds me that gripe.
I think I've probably said it reminds me this gripe nostalgia critic had about district nine.
Like, well, why are the aliens aliens?
Why couldn't you just make a movie about people?
Because I wanted to.
That's why shut the fuck up.
Because it's a fucking movie about aliens.
Why are there aliens in this alien movie?
It's like, well, I don't know.
Why are you just making a movie about black people?
Why didn't you send Joker in the future?
Yeah, why wasn't it why wasn't it?
Why wasn't it set in the stone age idiot?
Yeah, I don't know.
Joker didn't take place during the Renaissance.
This is where I was just like, what's your what's your argument here?
And fix the cropping on your fucking video.
Do you notice how stretchy it looks?
And I don't just mean minor annoying stuff like there's no way Arthur Fleck is on seven
psychiatric medications in the mid 80s and not basically comatose all the time.
Okay, okay.
Do you know the boogie tune is on like fucking 10 medications?
When I'm getting out there is the just because it's a large amount doesn't mean it's impossible.
My dad is on several medications.
Like, this is not something that is impossible.
I don't know why you would highlight the like.
He should be coming to the point.
He's finally gotten to the point in his video where he's starting to sort of say things that
are sort of a why.
But the first one is how come it takes place in the 80s and then he just has a Batman clip play.
Like no, no, no, no.
No, tell it explain.
Use words.
Use your thoughts.
Explain to us why it's bad that it takes place in the 1980s.
Tell us why that's bad.
We pass that now.
Too bad.
I know.
And now he's going on to now he's gone on to.
Are you telling me that he was on like seven medications in the 80s?
He's like, yeah, we had pills and stuff in the 80s.
Yeah, this was a thing that you could do.
What was the problem here?
It always goes for boogie.
I'm sorry.
I don't know anybody else who's like a famous YouTuber who has several medications as an easy
proof.
Like you can check this.
He's got a video about it.
I'm just saying this is a thing that happens.
I don't know why, but what a non point.
And like, let's say, for example, that it was a rule from doctors everywhere.
If you have any more than four medications, you die.
And he has seven in this movie.
I'd be like, I guess in this universe, you don't die when you have four.
It's such a weird.
I don't know.
Yeah, but it's like, what can you tell us?
Why the story doesn't make sense?
I know it's like, oh, no, seven.
He has seven, seven medications and he's not even in a coma is like, okay.
Oh, I remember there was this one analogy that like when I was in college and we were
talking about, you know, art criticism.
One of the things that my professor said that stuck with me was when somebody's, you know,
complaining about the curtains on the Titanic, they don't really have a valid argument
because it's the curtains on the fucking Titanic.
You know, it has nothing to do with what's going to, with what's going to affect the end result.
So that's what I think of when people say little things like that.
It's like, okay, he's on seven medications.
You can argue that that did or did not exist at that time.
If you want to do your research, you could probably find that out.
But at the end of the day, I, the medication, it doesn't matter the amount because he could
just be taking one pill and it's like, okay, he's taking one form of medication.
The amount doesn't matter.
The fact is when it comes into play is when he's talking to his two friends, which are
co-workers that the dude left out was that he's off of his medication and he feels great.
And, you know, the friends are alarmed by that.
That's the only time that really comes into play.
If he's saying that it's a problem, he needs to explain why or does he have a reference?
Does he have a study?
Yeah, I mean, all we can draw is that he's telling us that he should be comatose with his
bedded pills.
It's like, okay, I don't think that's true.
At the same time, he doesn't even know what those pills are.
Some of those pills could just be placebo pills that, you know, he thinks are working on him,
you know?
And why then could he be aspirin?
You know, he's taking aspirin.
Maybe he's taking something because, again, he was harmed as a child.
He's got, you know, some kind of brain damage.
He's probably taking something, you know, for his brain, maybe, I don't know, for his thyroid.
I don't know, any little thing.
And like you said, like, even if he was right about, like, in all these different ways and stuff,
like, is that it?
He taking too many pills for you?
That's it.
That's why we're working.
Okay.
Occasions in the mid 80s and not basically comatose all the time because prescription
strength was a whole different context back then.
And they're imposing a 2019 opioid second medication context on an 80s setting or how
a huge...
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
They, they, he has no, he has absolutely no evidence for any of that that he just said.
Yeah.
No evidence.
Even if he said prescription strength was higher back then.
Prescription strength, depending on the pill, is like, how can you make this claim definitively?
Like, how could, how could you possibly make the claim?
Let's just say one of the pills he takes is, I don't know, 20 milligrams.
And nowadays they only give you 10s because it's too powerful or whatever.
It's like you could still just take 20 with the two 10s put together.
It's like the idea that all prescriptions amounts have gone down since the 80s.
Thus he should have been in a coma.
What?
We got some, we got some boat curtains going on up in here.
I am not following you there, Bob.
Feels like, like this is what I would call like grasping at straws to hate the movie based on
if, based on a thing that if true is absolutely a nitpick.
He's supposed to be the one that hates us for that.
He's just, uh, this is his problem.
This is what he finds is, you know, the big plot hole in the movie is that he,
the amount of pills he's taking, which they explain.
He had a lot of trauma happen to him as a child.
So he's going to have problems growing up and he's going to have to take supplements for that.
It's like, yeah, not, not a pharmacist or literally nitpicking.
Not a pharmacist or a doctor, but I'm almost certain that he cannot be right with his claim.
And I'm just a layman.
Like it doesn't sound like this could be right.
Plot point.
The idea that they may have had stronger prescriptions back in the day.
I'm not disputing that.
It's the idea that, uh, they were so strong that you die if you had seven pills, non-descript pills.
Okay.
Like, you know, not all pills, like you have anything to do with each other, right?
Like not all pills do stuff that would conflict your body.
A lot of stuff going on in your body.
A lot of pills that do all kinds of different sorts of things.
And also doctors, when they see what pills they're prescribing you, they make sure that they
prescribe medications that aren't going to, you know,
interfere and interact with each other in a negative way on your body.
There's this whole episode.
Did you guys ever watch House?
Yes.
Yeah.
Okay.
Remember the episode where the blonde girl dies?
No.
Which one?
You don't know the bus accident?
The bitch.
The bitch.
Yeah, the, yeah, the, Jane Doe one.
And he's, he's like, Oh, I need to find this girl because something and he's trying to remember,
then he remembers.
And it's because he saw her taking this medication, but because she was in the bus accident and they
didn't know that she was on that medication, they give her this other medication that reacts
bad with medication she was taking.
So it kills her.
Okay.
So that would never happen when you're prescribing medication, you know?
Sorry, I'm just making a note that if you take seven pills, you die.
Seven pills die.
I'll go right into a Goodell video.
I think turns on what's essentially a video clip going viral, which didn't just happen back then.
I'm talking about the why of these.
Oh, I'm pretty sure that there are people who have argued against this.
This is a common argument against the film that there was no like home video bullshit
on TV.
That wasn't a thing.
And there are people who've argued that not only was there stuff like that, but
audiences would totally be on board with doing something like that.
There's nothing that we developed recently, like a reaction culture, the idea that you're
watching a show in the eighties and they're like, we're going to play you a clip from a
struggling comedian who embarrassed himself.
Do you really think the people at home be like, this is horrible.
Can't have this.
Oh, disgusting.
I mean, don't people remember like 20th America's Funniest Home Videos?
Well, the thing is, this is set in the 80s, is it this film?
Yeah, I thought America's Funniest Home Videos came out in the 80s.
Well, the thing is, I think it came out in the late 80s or something.
And it's just like, isn't that close enough to lend credence to this?
Yeah, I mean, it's like people didn't have fucking cameras in the 80s at all.
They were taking home videos.
I mean, didn't he say on TV that one of his scouts was out there and filmed it?
And then that's how he got the video.
I'd have to rewatch it out.
Well, I've got a lot of comedy clubs with their anyway.
Yeah, I could picture that.
I mean, let's say we've got the TV TV programs of 1981.
Dallas, MASH, The Jeffersons, Dynasty, Three's Company, Facts of Life, Happy Days, 60 Minutes,
The Love Boat, Magnum PI, Laverne and Shirley.
I mean, there's plenty of stuff that's going on.
Let's see if we want to do like this reality sort of shows.
Not to mention all of the game shows that took place.
Candid Camera, Queen for a Day.
Wait, Candid Camera was in 1981.
It was from Candid Camera started in 48.
And what's the premise of that show?
Candid Camera.
I think it's where there's just like a camera set up and it catches people.
Almost like punks.
You don't know they're being filmed.
Yeah, they put them in weird scenarios.
The fact that that exists, surely this functions as reasoning.
I mean, it's it's ridiculous to say that this couldn't happen.
It clearly could.
Because the other argument people make is that like,
nobody would do this to a man who's clearly mentally ill.
It's like, I don't think anyone in Gotham would have a shitty committee.
And yeah, that's the other fucking problem.
If you watch the footage, it would be the way that Murray is cut it,
or at least his team has cut it.
It's just the delivering the joke.
And to be honest with you, I don't even think it's that bad a joke.
It's Murray burns him straight after.
Like, and I think he doesn't involve all the context of him laughing when he gets on stage.
But even if he did, you'd be like, oh, God, this guy is so awkward.
He's laughing in his own joke before he delivers it.
That's pretty much the natural assumption.
Instead of being like, this man is clearly mentally ill.
Help him.
Do not laugh at him.
Like, I don't I feel like that's a bit of projection because like a 1980s audience
would just be like, look at this failing comedian lol.
I don't think they take it much further than that.
Well, I mean, he's also leaving out the context of, you know,
the way that he views Murray as a father figure,
and then the impact it has on when Murray is making fun of him on TV.
That's a pretty big thing that happens as to why, you know,
he does the thing that he does at the end.
I guess he's he's well, he's about to argue, by the way, that these things are problems,
but they don't matter.
At least that's what I thought I heard him say.
So I'm just going to let him carry on back then.
I'm talking about the why of these issues.
You see, setting a movie out of time, especially in the recent past,
is a big undertaking.
It's probably where most of this movie's 55 million dollar budget went.
Okay.
Remember the Dark Knight?
Remember, it's like, this is like earning money.
This is such a non sequitur.
It doesn't even matter.
Why are you talking about you?
Do you get it?
Because he said the most of the money probably went on
making the setting.
And then you have Joker from Dark Knight saying it's not about the money.
It's about sending a message, which doesn't.
You haven't told us why the message is bad.
You're the one saying that you can't identify.
You've asked us, but you haven't looked into it.
I'm giving him loads of benefit of the doubt here.
But maybe he's trying to say that it's the reverse for this film.
It's not about the message.
It's about spending money.
And even if that's the case.
Well, that'll be wrong, but I'm just saying.
There's no way this movie doesn't have a message.
It's just a stupid fucking premise from the beginning of this video.
Can a movie not have an aesthetic for its own sake?
Does the star, we need to have a reason to have things take place
where they take place.
This movie that takes place in Albuquerque, it has to take place.
Those flaws he highlighted, he thinks that setting in the 80s meant those things were
flaws while if they were set now, they wouldn't have been.
Like the the candid camera sort of thing, plus the medication.
He made arguments that imply that if this was set today, those things would make sense.
But he's wrong.
He's looking to try and prove that the setting was like done for whatever reason that gets in
the film's way.
But it's just the opposite.
But hey, at least we're actually getting arguments though.
Like I appreciate both for making an argument, even if it's terrible.
Okay, but I mean, okay, aside from the some of the costumes, the way that it's filmed,
you know, the filter that they put on after, you know, post.
But with the city, I mean, the city didn't look too different.
And that's one of the great things about cities is you could just film it.
You know, I could go to San Francisco, go down a random street in San Francisco,
put on a costume, you know, or dress in 80s clothing, film it, put a little filter over
it to make it look like it's a camera that's from the 80s.
And there you go.
It's a movie from the 80s.
That's something that's great about cities is in a way, as long as you don't go downtown,
where it's all ultra modern in the new part of the cities.
If you film in certain areas, you could do period pieces like this.
So I don't see what his big argument is.
And that's what it looked like.
There wasn't anything iconic about the, you know, the setting that where they filmed
aside from that one building where he goes in with Thomas Wayne, the opera house.
The stairs been made iconic, thanks to this film, as far as I can tell,
anyway, like people are going to the stays now just to take pictures.
It's not like they went and did all this, you know,
higher work with all of our budget into, you know, VFX.
They just went to different parts of New York and filmed and they didn't, you know,
I'm assuming they didn't remodel any of the buildings to make it look like it was from the 80s.
As I understand it, they used like a little bit of CGI in the buildings to like,
like the way they, you know, make it look like it was in the 80s.
Okay, that's actually pretty easy to do.
And for a film that didn't spend that much money relatively,
this is very strange that he's like, given this burning money kind of imagery here, you know,
man, they made a lot of money.
They made a crap ton of money for how little made a lot more money than Godzilla did.
I mean, it outperformed the Dark Knight made buddy.
Like that's pretty, that's a big deal.
Not to mention the outperform the Dark Knight with the role of the Joker,
which most people were like, you're not gonna be able to top Heath Ledger,
not making a claim that he did making the claim that it's a pretty tough role to come into.
But maybe, maybe Jared Leto made the made it easier for him.
I don't know.
No, I got no beef with Jared.
It's all good.
I still haven't seen that movie.
Black text on a black background.
That's so incompetent that film is.
You have to change the backgrounds, use different lighting,
dress sets down to tiny details, get old cars, old clothes, old TV and video,
reference photos, digitally alter the skyline.
If it's a real location, all kinds of stuff.
There's usually a specific reason it has to be done.
Does he not understand that they have to do every single movie and the way that
it's not where they're spending, what was it for like the Batman suit,
like 50 grand Bill making a Batman suit for what was his name?
The last Batman dude.
Ben Affleck.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
You get a what you spend like a couple hundred bucks making a little,
you know, red suit for the Joker and also everything that he just complained
about about the setting and, you know, the cars.
You can find all of that in New York.
Guess what they did.
I guess in movie Bob's mind, unless there's a specific reason
it cannot take place in modern time of filming.
If you're a filmmaker who enjoys the 80s just as a fucking time and place,
go away unless you have a reason to put it there.
Yeah, it movies need to be shot at the contemporary
time that they're being made unless they're specifically as a reason it cannot be shot at
that time because your artistic vision or if you just like the aesthetic of that time period
or the attitude of the time is something you just can't.
I just think this guy doesn't understand everything that he just complained about is
things that aren't necessarily difficult to do, especially in Hollywood with where
there's professional people that know how to do this very efficiently and, you know, on a budget.
I want to highlight two things that I've just spotted that are funny.
So first, a Bob Chipman tweet.
I don't know.
This was made in 2017.
The best day that will ever happen to humanity will be the moment when physical
strength becomes meaningless and intellectual with and creative vision
become the only measures of a human being to be considered.
That's the superior future.
Of course.
Well, he shared a look because he's bad at both.
Doesn't that make you think like, oh, you were beaten up when you were younger, were you?
Budget people beat you up.
I'm sorry about that.
I would just like to argue the point.
This fat loser would be like, I hope that in the future, strong people don't exist.
Well, as someone that just moved, I sincerely appreciate people with physical strength because
this shit was heavy.
Yeah.
Well, they're bullies.
They were bullying you by moving.
They were they were patriarchy new.
I 100% will accept the patriarchy if they want to help me.
Patriarchy is all good.
If you help me move.
And he helped me move furniture out of a moving truck.
I am 100% happy and grateful.
Also, I guess you Bob doesn't understand the kind of like main.
I know movie Bob doesn't understand this, but maintaining a strong body
takes a lot of willpower and consistency and perseverance.
You know, it's it's not like, again, Bob had no fucking clue about any of this,
but they're the old they'll saying Anima Sana and Corey Corporia Sano, you know,
a sound mind and a sound body like they're both two parts that are, you know, important.
You know, you want to have a healthy body because you're you know, your brain and the way that you
live and your health that all comes together and it creates one whole you it's important.
Oh, and as as some time alone highlighted, I think we kind of went over it a little bit,
but there'll be in this there'll be an industry in Hollywood that's like we make old timey cars
so you can rent us out and we'll give you access to all of these.
Same for costumes and everything else.
It's not as it's not like this built from the ground up and they've been to a cinder.
Every single film is made like, no, no, this stuff gets carried over and saved and everything.
I think it wasn't it.
I only know this thanks to Red Lab Media.
But if a Star Trek episode is using like a bunch of stuff in like the Victorian era,
there's a good chance that a TV show was filming something Victorian in the area at the time and
that they just were able to grab the bunch of costumes and be like, yeah, now we can do this.
Also, apparently in Jeremy Johns review of Knives Out, he said,
another thing that Ryan Johnson's movies have in common is they're not as clever as he thinks they
are. Oh, that was that was such a fun thing to hear him say.
Oh, come on, if you have Jeremy, do it.
Someone actually posted that in the comments of I believe the Knives Out trailer
or trailer on that video, the Knives Out trailer.
Jeremy, go and eat fat.
Jerry, go on.
He like answers it like, sure.
What?
Yeah, why not?
Anyway, we might carry on, Bob, but in all kinds of stuff.
So there's usually a specific reason it has to be done.
A point that the story is making or frozen at six forty three.
Oh, my God.
Are you frozen?
That's that's that's a here.
That's again, a sequel.
So while she's getting caught up, I just has.
What is Bob ever said about the incels?
Because there's no way Bob's getting poontang.
I mean, dude, no bullshit is so I thought you said he was married.
What was who?
No, I was curious.
I was wondering.
I don't know.
He's married to a he's a married to an Admiral Holdo doll.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I mean, isn't there that Ryan Gosling movie where he like has a sex doll that he
takes around and pretends that's his actual girlfriend?
Maybe movie, Bob.
That's an inspiration.
I can't believe I can't believe I ever feel sorry for a sex doll.
Imagine being film Roberts sex doll.
Just just just I can just hear the slap against the sex.
Oh, he calls it apparently.
Because he's he's posted pictures before of his basement apartment.
That's what he calls it.
His basement apartment.
My apartment's above ground because I'm his basement apartment.
I love the idea of rags as I live above ground a move.
I was like, you above ground.
You think you're so much better than he is.
We're in a Phantom of the Opera mask.
Above the ground, they will learn nothing.
But in the darkness, I dwell my criticized movies.
Did you guys ever watch that Puss in Boots TV show?
No, no, no, no evil.
Huh?
That's a thing.
That's a thing.
That is a thing.
Is it based off of the Shrek one?
Yes, it is.
Is it like funny?
Is it Shrek good or is it Shrek three quality?
And no, it's horrendously awful.
But there's an episode where there's all people and there's a mole people kingdom.
And then the mole people, something happened to where the cat people were digging a well.
And it led into the mole people land.
And the mole people want to take over the cat land.
But that that's and they've talked about.
Oh, above grounders.
I thought you were saying mole people.
Well, they were around.
So I'm, you know, wow.
You could be one of them.
That's shapist.
Silency.
She knows what she did.
I'm just picturing like how how does every day movie Bob has to wake up in his basement apartment.
Have his mom make him breakfast.
He's like a 45 year old man or something.
I'm going to make sure to say basement apartment in Godel.
Basement apartment.
And he has to go online and play this this super intellectual holier than thou piece of
shit character essentially and act all big and bad and tough and super smart.
But he's he knows that he's doing this from a basement apartment
and that he's this fat slob who doesn't take care of himself.
And he's just this pathetic human being.
I must be really tough like to live with that every day, you know.
No, it's really where on a man's psyche.
It's what drove him to become Diabeto.
They will respect me now.
So who is Diabeto's counter?
Like Magneto's got Professor X.
So who's the exercise or the exercise?
It's like this treadmill.
He's going to give you a shot of insulin.
That is his arch-nosis.
The dieter.
Do you remember in X-Men 3 where they have those things that they take your powers away
when they get injected into you?
That would be insulin for him.
He'd be like, no, because it's like my power, my diabetes.
Instead, it takes his fat away and he just like he shrivels.
He's just like, well, my sex is true.
Picturing the fucking creature from the moisturized creature from Doctor Who,
this deflated flap of skin with a face.
And it's just like, no.
There was an episode of Aquitine Hunger Force where Carl had like a parasite inside of him.
And he got really, really skinny.
And that's kind of how I picture Movie Bob with all of his powers sucked out of him,
all of his lard just squeezed out.
Professor exercise.
No, not my sickness.
All kinds of stuff.
So there's usually a specific reason it has to be done, a point that the story is making
or a portion of the narrative that can only be conveyed in the sense of that temporal context.
Usually in a social, political, or historical.
Oh, it's not playing for you?
Yeah, just reload.
Yeah, just try reloading it.
Should work.
Is it up for you?
I have to go.
Where did you leave off it?
I should automatically drag you if I do this.
Oh, okay.
Okay, 640.
We'll go to 650.
Bars, old clothes, old TV and video clips, match reference photos, digitally alter the skyline if
it's a real location, all kinds of stuff.
So there's usually a specific reason it has to be done, a point that the story is making
or a portion of the narrative that can only be conveyed in the sense of that temporal context.
Usually in a socio-political or historical reference point.
But basically none of Joker's socio-political reference points have any connection to the
historical context they're being juxtaposed with.
Aside from the very, very, very blatantly connected one that, by the way, like,
you'd think Movie Bob would know about it.
The whole social programs getting cut thing in the 80s.
I'm pretty sure, actually.
So the top comment on his video.
Why does this movie take place in the 1980s?
I don't know, Bob.
It's almost like that was the time when Reagan era budget cuts gutted the nation's mental
health protections, leaving an entire generation of desperate, ill people thrown onto the street
because society literally did not care about them.
The video clips did not go viral.
Yeah, they did.
Like, at least in a different way.
Like, it's different to think about, given our current time.
But before the internet, there was a huge hegemony of cultural interest.
Everyone watched the news.
Everyone read the papers.
Everyone watched the big game.
And almost everyone watched the big show of the night.
A la SNL, Johnny Carson, et cetera.
So if one of those people did that for a quick laugh and they did occasionally do that,
then it would be seen by basically everyone.
The historical setting does not impact the theme or plot of the story.
Again, did you just forget that Reagan and the rise of moral majority was a thing?
Joker's whole thing fits neatly into the framing of large, powerful government types,
telling poor, disenfranchised and sometimes incredibly vulnerable people that they just
need to pull up their bootstraps, buck up and say no to drugs.
And that didn't work.
And they were just bum bum social parasites.
Yeah, he said, I know you have a lot of weird hang ups.
I know you have a lot of really weird hang ups about class,
but this is really basic, obvious stuff.
What is the thing?
He's not going to draw connect.
This is his second Joker video, and he's not even going to put out a correction for that shit.
But whatever.
I guess we're going to take a minute to appreciate how wrong he is.
A moment of silence.
Through here a little bit.
Let's see.
Someone said the least believable part of Joker is that investment bankers would be taking the subway.
I mean, if they're drunk.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Who knows?
Who knows?
That happens all the time.
I mean, if you're heading home drunk with some friends and you're like,
this is the fucking subway is going.
We could just go that way.
Home is fast.
Okay.
I mean, you don't want to drive.
You know what I mean?
I don't know.
It seems a bit weird.
Is he saying they should get a taxi?
Well, I mean, they could just be taking the subway from one bar to another.
You know, I didn't see any briefcases with them.
Bob likes to pretend all of his rhetorical questions don't have answers when they just do.
And he just doesn't give a shit.
So true.
Anyway.
And neither does that juxtaposition provide any meaningful counter-context.
The anti-rich people clown mobs are a joker-fied mashup of the Occupy Wall Street and Anonymous
movements, both of which were phenomenons of the early 2000s.
They don't make sense transposing to what we are, I guess, supposed to take as an otherwise
similar recreation of a 1980s city.
Yeah, there weren't there were writers in the 80s.
There weren't like protest movements in the 80s.
People protesting something happening here.
I'm going to go as far as saying that this has been a thing since there was societies
of any kind, civilizations.
There was groups of people who would want to potentially rise up and do something about it.
You don't have to reference like the fact that he's picked those two and said these are not
occurring in a time in which this film is set.
They're for bad.
It's like, no, no, that's not how that works.
I mean, it could be a compilation of different things.
I mean, Jesus Christ, you wouldn't even at that point, you wouldn't even need to.
That's still fine.
So like, what prevents it from being in an earlier time?
Like, oh, literally nothing.
Like, oh, so why can't it be in this time?
Oh, I don't know.
I just don't want it to be like, okay.
What's one of those you just flip around and say, what's wrong with it being in this time?
Like, I'm going to go ahead.
What's the problem here?
My heart take.
This is fictional.
This movie, it's not actually a documentary.
So what I can't be just like, I'm sorry.
Red pill, black pill, incel, loser, nerd, white man, like Joker, my hero.
I guess not.
Oh, I'm sorry.
So movements, both of which were phenomenons of the early 2000s, they don't make sense
transposing to what we are, I guess, supposed to take as an otherwise similar recreation.
Also, this is this is his interpretation of what the crowds are supposed to be.
Yep.
And he's saying my interpretation doesn't make the interpretation that I made up doesn't make
any sense to me.
A mob can't just be a mob of people.
I can't represent.
It has to be referential to a particular riot.
Yeah, some political.
He looked at this fucking mob in the movie,
compared to Occupy Wall Street, because they both wear masks.
Yeah, that's what I mean.
It's really surface level for you know why he did this.
He wants to try and say the movie's bad, but he's got really thin and few arguments.
Also, Baywin just said 1992 King riots day of mass violence, looting and murder,
because one man was being beaten by the police.
I obviously would need to look into it.
But yeah, I'm kind of just going for the whole like riots on specific to a decade.
Okay, I don't I don't think anybody would.
There were mass protests and riots and all that stuff.
That's just this is not like a super modern phenomenon.
It's weird that you think that like around 2004 people started like gathering in the streets.
They just said, Hey, guys, I got an idea.
Right.
You look at that.
Keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.
Oh, no.
I think that it says police class.
You stole my sign.
Sign was everything to me.
I like the perfect depiction of movement in 2D.
It amuses me.
It is very well done.
Terminator two themes just playing in my head as I'm looking at this picture.
He'll be the new terminator when they make it the reboot again.
He's the T.
Terminator 64 thousands.
It's a giant Gillette ball rolls in a tree terminator.
Anyway, it's both of which were phenomenons of the early 2000s.
They don't make sense transposing to what we are.
I guess you can't be against corruption like the sign you fucking put in your fucking photograph
says can't be against corruption.
Corruption is a a very modern thing.
It's an inherently 2000s thing, right?
No, not a 1980 thing.
No corruption before that.
People weren't concerned about class anonymous or welfare issues,
which were phenomenon to the early 2000s.
They don't make sense transposing to what we're I guess supposed to take as an otherwise
similar recreation of a 1980 city environment because urban mass violence.
Flashpoints in the 80s were almost always about racial tension.
The one degree or another right there, so they can't be about anything else.
Oh my God.
The brain.
The brain hurts.
Did you understand that there was like a darkie?
Oh my God, even they think, oh, then in the real world, these protests were mostly about race.
Well, then I guess you can't fucking have protests about anything else.
I'm just going to be like, monopoly protests.
There was no Gotham in the 1980s that had an Arthur Fleck in it that became a Joker.
So this is all inaccurate.
Fucking shit movie doesn't know what it's doing.
Yeah, Gotham's not real.
Gotcha.
Ha.
Point me to the guy.
I don't remember.
Do you guys remember?
Is there a video clip?
We can find this of a guy dressed in a Joker outfit shooting a coat like a host of a show.
Is that a thing?
Apparently, this film is all made up.
That's dumb.
Fucking hate my films that are made up.
Did you guys know that Lord of the Rings is based entirely on reality?
I hope so.
It's great.
Yeah, he would explain.
Yeah, Super Bowl.
You explain Bob.
He does look like an orc.
How dare you?
Orcs about that ugly.
Okay, okay.
Look, Gotham may not have looked at his best, but he tried.
I can just fix it.
She says I've read a Gotham book and he's like, hey, hey, hey, Lertz was definitely not.
Well, after the War of the Ring, it was hard to get a job as an orc.
So I started reviewing movies in my Hobbit home, my cave in Mordor, in my basement apartment.
I don't know, man.
I'm sure it's an actual term for all I'm aware, but like describing apartments that are basements.
It sounds like the kind of thing you'd say when you don't want to say basement.
It's my basement apartment.
You're like, okay.
You probably should have just said there's certainly.
There's certainly apartments that like, if it's like a three story apartment building,
the lower story will be slightly underground.
But I don't think anyone ever refers to it as a basement apartment.
I think it really just lives in a basement.
Basement man bed.
My above ground dwelling.
Well, it's like the nicest way you could say you live under a bridge.
It's like my sub would be a bridge like a trans poor.
I don't even know.
I just realized that this started an argument in four words that's trending
the argument dispelled incorrectly.
They tried.
Don't know given about that.
That's supposed to take as an otherwise similar recreation of a 1980s city environment,
because urban mass violence flashpoints in the 80s were almost always about racial tension
to one degree or another.
And there's no context given in the movie for anything happening.
It's making Gotham situation different speak.
It doesn't matter if it's about race.
You fucking gelatin tub of goo.
It's what we had criticism like it's not about race.
It's like people can't have legitimate like grievances.
I guess not.
If it's not about race, then shut up.
You chunked hard.
Maybe for anything happening, that's making Gotham situation any different.
Speaking of which, the lone historical illusion in the film is about that very thing.
Joker's first killing on the subway and elevation to folk hero status by the media
is a clear evocation of the 1984 Bernie gets shootings for a white guy named.
No, there's no messages in the film.
Apparently, this is a very strong message.
He's probably gonna say it says nothing about it, but apparently.
Okay, so there was a killing on a subway that was possibly racist from this guy,
or is I don't know the specifics.
That means that they have to be alluding to racism in Joker.
It's like, does it?
Can it just not be the crime itself?
Or the the act of everyone who watched this movie basically got the message,
and he's pulling up New York Post newspapers of Bernie gets and stuff like that.
Columbine Columbine like, man.
Like, do you not think that all this stuff can't happen?
Like, what about this is like, unbelievable to you?
Like, what about do you not think that a crowd of people can have grievances for class reasons
or for welfare reasons or for social mobility reasons or for city management reasons?
All of these reasons by people like a large group of people might protest in the streets,
and those protests might become violent.
Like, does he think that just doesn't happen?
Like, this is wild, this world that he lives in this.
And he's been in that basement too long.
Oh, my goodness.
Professor exercise.
They even got McAvoy in there.
Hamstrings of justice.
Professor exercise.
Such a shitty movie, but I want to see it.
I'm looking for jump rope, old friend.
I will bring you jump rope in the form of a Twizzler.
The more you hate the harder it is.
Four black teenagers he claimed tried to rob him on a New York subway
and eventually surrendered to police claiming self-defense,
but was later revealed to have said a bunch of really, really suspicious,
racist stuff leading up to it.
And also the kids were maybe just panhandling and the whole thing was a huge scandalous mess.
But that happened after the media had already spent months writing about a heroic subway vigilante.
I don't like the twist this joke is taking.
So what does that say about the film?
Well, yeah,
there's never been another crime on a subway or somebody's gotten killed
aside from this one instance.
And this has this movie has to be referencing this one instance in one list.
So this is really upset that Joker is not like trying to give a racial message.
That's like I said before, these people are really upset.
This film did not tell the message that they they thought it should sell.
And you're like, I'm sort of.
So like the whole the let's just say he's talking to the top fellows.
And on one hand, he says, so you were evoking this subway shoe and yeah.
And he and he goes, no, I've never heard of that before.
Movie Bob's upset.
He's like, that's insensitive.
You should know about this if you're going to do this.
Okay, so that's one hand.
The other hand, he didn't know about it.
And he's like, so what does your film have to do with racism?
And he's like, well, I mean, I'm gunning for the act itself had happened.
And so that it's a similar one to this, but I'm not I'm not gunning for the whole like
race angle because that's not what joke is about.
And then Bob's just like, well, that's wrong.
It's just silence because that's not an argument.
And that's where we are.
This is these videos are painful to get to because they seem so disjointed
and they're so little to grab on to.
It's like trying to, I don't know, like trying to.
Those glasses are crooked.
He couldn't even fix the perspective on those glasses.
I know it's very simple.
Photoshop like, come on, dude.
I'm at 744.
Where are you at?
Yeah, what are we looking at?
745.
I see the Joker.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no.
No movie, Bob.
You did not blow my mind.
Oh, that's bothering the shit out of me.
Don't worry.
I'll get there.
Seemingly edging the new verb evoking this famous event,
cutting out its distinctly 80s race politics and substituting the visual
language of 2019 class politics allows it to say.
So, yeah, so he's frustrated that Todd has taken elements of different
events across our own history and put them into, you know,
a melting pot of destruction for this society in this fictional city.
And he's like, okay, fine.
You did all of that, but you said nothing with it.
It's like, oh, is that right?
So, like, it would be okay if it meant something, right?
So, Bob, just bear with me and we'll be able to explain it to you
because apparently you're having trouble.
But I'm assuming this is where he's going to his big climax is going to be
where he explains the movie is meaningless.
It's the same way that Arthur's issues with cuts to his social services
and medication have the look of an 80s health care system,
but are presented in the manner that's all about 2019's various prescription
addiction opioid crisis.
He did it again.
Oh, my God.
It means that people only have opioid addiction in 2019.
That's never existed.
Do people don't overdose?
People don't have medication needs.
People don't need prescriptions.
People like maybe like prescriptions are, let's see.
When did prescriptions start?
History of prescription drugs.
Okay, that's like saying, I don't know if you guys ever watch it,
but on the Andy Griffith Show, there's this little old lady that's really nosy.
And so she has to go to the pharmacist to get pills because she's got to take her pills.
She's a little lady.
She needs her pills.
And then there's a new pharmacist and she says, well, you don't have a prescription.
So I can't give you the pills.
And then the whole episode is about this little lady pretending that she's dying
because she's not getting her pills because the new pharmacist won't give her her pills,
even though the old pharmacist would always give her pills without a prescription.
And then you find out at the end of the episode that they've just been placebo pills,
that the old pharmacist was just giving it to her.
So she would, you know, she's okay.
She's got her pills kind of thing.
And it's like you're saying that that using movie Bob's logic,
that that is supposed to be a representation of somebody's addiction in 2019,
whereas this was a TV show that was filmed, what, in the fifties?
Come on, dude.
Such a narrow point of view.
And it doesn't lead him anywhere.
He's like, oh, it's you're evoking something that didn't happen in this time.
And you're like, do you know this?
Well, in fairness, I'm misquoting there.
He's just saying it happened in this other time.
And it's like, I guess that's just the time for that thing.
Even though it's a very broad issue.
Does movie Bob want a documentary?
Apparently, I think he needs one.
Like he needs like this needs to be a this needs to be a documentary
about real events that actually happened.
And maybe the only thing he can accept is.
I don't know the name of the city or I don't I don't know.
Like this isn't real.
It's it's fine to take things that actually occurred
and sort of change them around and repurpose them.
They make sense.
It's like a whole riot thing.
Yeah, sure.
Let's say let's say that movie Bob in in the real ladies,
like all of the violent riots were explicitly only racial related.
All right.
There is nothing that say that it isn't logical that a mob could form
or that a violent protest could form for a number of other reasons.
The fact that this is his problem with a movie should be,
if anything, just a a beacon for how good the movie is.
It takes a lot for me to call like issues with the film
petty to the point of pointlessness, but that's what we have here.
These are like non issues.
Yeah, I'm struggling to actually understand exactly what the problem is.
What does he want?
What do you want?
Tell me what I want.
I want my headache from this guy to go away.
You'll be cured in approximately three minutes.
Who knows?
I don't know.
That'll last though.
Three minutes is going to be another hour.
I don't know what you mean.
Yep.
Or the viral video thing, which is trying badly to plug a critique
of present day social media shaming of ordinary people into an incompatible era
where the big concern about media privacy was paparazzi and celebrity tabloid.
See again, he's echoing the point that you can't have him be humiliated on a TV show.
That can't happen.
It doesn't work.
It doesn't work in the exact same way.
Therefore, parallels can't be drawn.
Thanks, Bob.
When your galaxy brain saving the day once, once more.
My head hurts so bad.
I'm surprised how much of this video is these things happen in different times.
They should be happening in those times, not this time.
Session using cheesy references to a movie from that era about that thing.
A movie that was, of course, a thematic reunion feature for the director and star of another
movie that Joker takes the bulk of its late 70s, early 80s reference cues from and very much.
See how he's very nebulous about what it's taking from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy.
Because I hear this all the time.
I hear that it's supposed to be copies of it.
It's really close to it.
People never really explain why, though, and I've never seen these movies.
So Joker worked perfectly fine for me without me seeing these, the quote unquote source material.
Well, what you don't realize is Joker stole from those films.
When you finally watch those, which you will, you'll find yourself watching and being like,
oh, my goodness, this is this.
I'd say this is a ripoff of Joker if I if I didn't know better.
But I guess we'll see.
I guess we'll see if that's your reaction, because I've seen Taxi Driver several times
before I saw Joker and yeah, I managed to survive.
So I'm not even sure how at this point because I just keep getting told.
That's the case.
We'll have a podcast for that one, guys.
Don't worry.
Joker deserves to be looked at as a ripoff of those other films.
Please tell me that podcast is not going to be a dressing up again.
No, it's a different YouTube.
It's not Bob.
Oh, my God.
It's OK.
Because this guy this guy's oh, I can't believe I made it this far.
Much wants you to be thinking of at all times.
Taxi Driver, because that's a great film for a great film about an alienated loner losing his
grip on reality and turning to violent power fantasies and an unfeeling urban hellscape.
It created the universally understood language of such films.
And while Joker may be running on fumes, those fumes are an understanding that
if it can recite the language phonetically, it doesn't need to understand or speak it.
You're not saying anything.
Just fucking weird salad.
What he just said is like, so you have a fucking parrot, basically.
That's what he's just associated with Joker.
So they can repeat the words.
There's no idea how it made them or what they for or what they do.
That's an interesting conclusion.
You've not provided any evidence for this.
I mean, maybe if you actually watch the movie, you would understand.
And then I just frustrated on his description of what happened.
I don't think he did.
He thinks he's so clever by describing a parrot in a really complicated.
Well, I say more complicated way than just saying a parrot.
And but he hasn't supported this at all.
He's just said it.
So good job, man.
I could just say the reverse.
It wouldn't make any sense.
But it's not unheard of on the UFAP.
The idea that something ripped off something that came after it.
Does anyone know what I'm referencing?
Hey, J Log, but you were there for that.
Do you remember what I was looking at my fucking Robocop was.
I'm forgetting this.
I don't remember if I was on that show.
So that Star Wars ripped off Robocop.
Oh, God.
Robocop came after.
How can you make that claim?
It's just one that wasn't made with it.
Just he didn't he didn't think he didn't think about the dates.
He just thought it and said it didn't say, you know what, I should go.
Who cares about accuracy?
Because more references being accurate.
Who fucking cares?
That's just how we feel.
Did movie Bob say that or yes.
There's a remarkable.
No.
Yeah.
Oh, and that is a remarkable claim.
Or an understanding that it can recite the language phonetically.
It doesn't need to understand or speak it.
This is a good thing.
If there's more clips like this, we can just skip over them essentially.
Clips to make a time.
Honestly, because I really got no idea what this is for.
He needs to get it to 10 minutes.
Is it to split up the topics?
Also, actually, yeah, if you remove all of the clips, we might
have it sink under 10 minutes.
You could be right on that.
But that's what he's doing.
I know he does this in all of his big picture ones that he tries to.
I think the idea is to break up thoughts between sections.
I don't know though.
Break up thoughts.
I know right.
And that's what I mean by this movie not really being about anything
because it's all texture with nothing underneath Arthur.
You haven't proven this.
Yeah.
Tell us why all the things that everybody is saying that it's about are not true.
Don't just keep don't just assert blindly that
nope, there's nothing here.
So he spends the whole fucking video saying it's meaningless,
but he hasn't proven any of it.
And then you have me like, or whoever else working for hours
going through the plot meticulously to get all your evidence to prove a point.
And they're like, because they did 10 minute videos saying it was meaningful.
Just like, oh yeah, repeat that over and over again.
Nothing that he has said before this supports the idea that there's no meaning.
Yeah, it's because he left out like all of the main details.
Like we're, we're in the end game now.
This is the end of the video almost.
He's going to be wrapping up soon.
He said anything about anything because it's all texture with nothing underneath it.
Arthur's big speech sounds and directed and is staged like a big important scene
where something meaningful gets said in a movie like this at this point.
The fuck is happening?
I don't know.
I don't think he wants to say anything.
There were riot.
He doesn't say anything like, like meaningful thing.
No, remember, Jenny Nichols said that the message was super heavy handed and she,
she like, she acknowledged it, but she didn't like get it.
You know, like she said it, but she didn't recognize it.
Say that he's saying there was nothing really sad.
And she's saying the message was too obvious that we're dealing with.
Yeah. How many times in the, um, the final scene here of, uh, where joker is on the show
and he's chatting and shitting and all that stuff.
And Jenny talks about how heavy handed it is.
And here we have movie Bob, one of, one of her great white nights, right?
Saying that there's no meaning here.
There's no message.
There's nothing.
So it could simultaneously be empty and heavy handed and obvious.
This is hurtful.
It's where the action and score tell us society has broken down,
but we don't know what not broken meant in this world.
It's grimy.
And what you know what a not broken world is.
Why do you have to see the shitty?
How, how do you not know what a not broken world is?
Is all the bad stuff.
Minus that the bad stuff.
It's okay.
Yeah, let's help them out.
Okay.
So social programs that are actually instated and a functioning well,
people getting paid and respected for their jobs,
people who are kind to each other during traveling or meeting each other,
all of your standard sort of societal interactions running well
and people respecting each other.
That's the world the Joker wants.
Yeah.
Everyone's making money.
They're pursuing their dreams.
They're, they're not under, you know, duress and stress.
You know, it's getting along crimes, low, welfare is down because people don't need it
because economy's thriving and all this stuff.
You, you know, what a good, this is it.
You know, we wanted was we needed a prologue, dude,
where it's just a really happy world.
Everything's happy and great.
And then it says 10 years later.
And then we cut to the film.
We want to go back to happy fun time.
Oh boy.
Yeah, I know.
I'm seeing, I've been collecting memes throughout this whole stream.
And Wolf, I think I know which one you just saw.
This is beautiful.
I mean, it's not, but it is.
Oh my God.
It's shelter in between his tits.
He's got a turkey.
I'm burning his toes.
Oh my God.
The dude, the turkey man.
That, that bird flew there thinking it would be shelter.
Little did it die.
It died and cooked under there.
It actually cooked.
And then he'll just pluck it out once it's done and eat it.
Do you think he like, he used his like thumbnails to scrape the skin off the legs?
I like the size of the laptop, by the way.
That's a big ball.
Yeah.
Oh my goodness.
It's got the right amount of juices for my tits.
For my titanic tits.
It's 17% sweat.
I just want to thank everyone watching and sending me these memes because otherwise
Movie Bob would have killed me several times by now.
She's Movie Bob the Hutt.
It's like at this point, I'm just like staring at Twitter hoping I find more memes.
It'll make me survive the next minute and a half of this garbage video.
You just, you always gives me a headache.
Any reason you don't like his video is because it's terrible.
Yes.
Yeah.
Knew it.
You biased toward good things.
Anyway.
Oh my god.
Oh god.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on.
Someone gave Diabido another nemesis to rival professor exercise.
Dr. Anne Solon.
Anne.
Dr. Anne Solon.
Oh, Rags doesn't like it.
I'm sorry.
You just don't like it because you didn't come up with.
Of course.
Yeah, I wouldn't come up with that.
I don't know about that myself.
I feel like that's an actual Rags joke.
I don't know.
I feel like I would start making it, but I would have, I'd bail out of that.
I'd abort mission halfway through and say, yeah, you know.
Exercise over.
I feel like there's an excellent joke there.
All right, you'll figure it out given time.
But we don't know what not broken meant in this world.
It's grimy and edgy and poised on the edge of urban apocalypse like early 80s movies were.
But without the authentic real world outside the theater context,
those movies were feeding off of.
It's just an echo, a reference, the equivalent of an old time.
Using a comic or on a photo app.
All right, he's using a comic book template on his footage.
I like how he's showing video footage of scenes he didn't even claim were in the movie.
Well, his plot summary was pointless.
I don't even know why he had it.
Yeah, it is.
Because he had to make references to the actual Joker.
He's at this point, he's just making up things that don't happen in the movie,
but he's showing video so that way we can.
Video filter on a photo app and what little semblance of a point it does offer to make
contradicts what little text it actually has.
Arthur all the bellows that society turned him into the Joker,
but we and he just got done finding out that it was actually just his mother.
That was primarily response.
Wow.
Is he really trying to put what happened to Arthur all on his mom?
Yeah, that's this.
This informs it all, guys.
His previous video, he said it's all because of a woman.
And so here we go.
There were deleted scenes.
This is how you rationalize it.
Oh, my God.
His mom paid off the kids in the beginning.
His mom told the clown to sell him the gun.
I'm trying to go steer my son's sign.
He's dressed as a clown.
His mom is the one that beat him when he was a child and tied him up to a furnace.
His mom is the one that did everything bad to him ever.
Okay, great.
And the fact that his mom dealt with a system that couldn't take care of her as well,
that's her fault.
His mom also gave that tape to Murray.
She told Murray to laugh.
Like roast his ass.
My son, he needs a lesson.
Oh, my God, man.
Like, this is why we do this.
They watched the movie, but they didn't.
That happens more times than it should.
But it seems like it happens all the time.
Where we have to ask, did you watch the movie you're trying to tell us about?
Because we watched the movie and we just don't follow at all with anything that you're saying.
Even if it's a movie, I don't like.
I'll watch it a couple times so I can soak up everything.
So I know what I'm talking about when I'm when I talk about it.
This dude's like, well, you know, fuck it.
You know, it's about nothing.
I'll make a video after probably watching it once.
Or the mob was behind it all.
She puppeteered everything.
She was the criminal mastermind.
Joker's so skinny.
I'm so jealous.
I'm gonna make a video trash this movie.
I wish I could find my bones.
Find my bones.
Yeah, let's play it again.
Make sure that's what he said.
Pretty clear, but hey.
It's what little text it actually has.
Arthur Albert Bellows that society turned him into the Joker.
But we and he just got done finding out that it was actually just his mother
that was primarily responsible for like 90% of what happened.
I like how he says it's just his mother that was primarily
responsible for the joke.
It's like, oh, so there was secondary things?
No.
It was a combination of multiple sources.
Oh, that's not what I meant.
Well, it's like this thing everyone's been saying.
You're taking words from my mouth hole and you're twisting them.
No one takes things from my mouth hole.
And he said 90%.
How do you qualify that?
He qualify?
Seriously?
I didn't even hear that.
He didn't watch the movie.
He said 90% happened to him.
Yeah, he said 90%.
Hang on.
I'm just gonna play it so everyone hears it.
Turned him into the Joker.
But we and he just got done finding out that it was actually just his mother
that was primarily responsible for like 90% of what happened.
How the fuck did he qualify?
So nine out of 10 things that happened to him are his mother.
All right.
That's definitely, that's definitely, that can definitely be supported by scenes from the film.
It's like the kids beat him up.
His mom gave the gun to, I don't remember the character's name, but the other clown.
And this is like a scene where she's like,
Arthur, you should take the gun to your job with the children.
Do it.
I don't know, Bob.
This sounds like a bad idea.
Do it, Arthur.
Do it.
Do it.
What movie did you watch, Bob?
Oh, bloody hell.
All right, little ikes.
I want you to beat the shit out of my son.
He needs to be like some twisted version of the Truman show.
She's just like, how much can we do until this motherfucker snap?
At the end, she's in the hospital and they're like, why did you do this to him?
She's like, I was bored.
Then the credits roll.
Yeah.
I wanted amusement, Arthur.
The movie, Bob's like, wow.
It was like mostly her.
It's like 90% of her.
What the fuck?
I was bored and now I'm dead.
It's fucking worth it, I tell you.
What a weird world he lives in.
And he killed her for it.
In fact, if you pull out the ultimately meaningless references to other movies
and comic book Easter eggs and ignore the filmmakers and Warner Brothers
marketing have claimed the movie is about and just went by what's on screen,
you might conclude that Joker is just a straightforward if pointedly
extra misogynist serial killer.
He's like, aside from everything else, no reference to watch about me.
It's like, go fuck yourself.
You did not watch this.
He wasn't supporting the other claim.
So why would we expect him to support that?
So you're telling me that Arthur, a guy that, you know, he lives with his mother.
He takes care of his mother.
She's in bed.
He washes her.
He feeds her.
He does everything to provide for his mother.
He, you know, makes up this whole relationship with a girl because he
ever he hates her.
That's why he would be in a relationship.
He is a misogynist.
Yes, and the relationship he makes up is like romantic.
It's never sexual, gross, or fetishy.
It's just like, he just wants to love someone and to be loved.
It's like his fantasy with Murray has them hug.
Gay power.
That's Miss.
And he's not going to hug a woman.
Oh, my God.
I saw it.
I love these people know what these words mean before they say that.
I don't think they do.
What do you think?
Okay.
Rags using using all of your movie.
Bob known thing.
How do you think he would rationalize the film is misogynist?
Because he killed his mother.
And there are other people who did bad things to him that he didn't kill.
Therefore, I got one.
He's being unfair to his mother.
So the woman was used as an object of desire instead of having a character.
Yeah, he wanted.
He wanted a healthy relationship with a woman.
What a piece of shit.
Movie pop doesn't know what a relationship with a woman is.
Cut him some slack.
Oh, that poor man.
I don't know what it is about him.
But every time we watch a video with him, he literally makes me physically ill.
Let's get his let's see if he explains what I feel like listening to a video from him.
He's like sitting next to the fourth nuclear reactor in Chernobyl for like an hour.
This is so painful.
There is just I've been I've been provided an image that I think you guys will appreciate.
Okay, it will.
It'll make you feel better.
All right.
Okay, here we go.
You guys ready?
Yeah, okay.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no, oh, my goodness.
Three amigos.
This is his arc is across the trilogy of movie about films.
Oh, my God.
It's a patrol on the streets.
Sweating the sheet.
Look at the wheel.
Look at the wheels on the tricycle thing.
Oh, I get it.
It looks like one wheel is about to fall off, too.
I'm just a scoot himself.
If you know what I mean?
Look at his little arms.
Oh, my God.
Beowyn, you're the greatest thing that's ever happened to this world.
And I love you.
Goodness.
Why are you so good at drawing fat people?
The three forms of dick.
Well, we're going here.
Three horsemen of the apocalypse.
Oh, my God.
Maybe this is describing.
So you got like the genre films.
You got like your movie, Bob, film.
You're a superhero movie, Bob, film with your sci-fi movie, Bob, film.
He's a very versatile actor, you see.
Yes, intense stuff.
No doubt.
Okay, here we go.
A drama about how the abused, infantilized Arthur belatedly achieved psychotic
manhood as the confident, swaggering joker by escaping and killing the controlling,
abusive mother figure who'd infantilized him in the first place.
Oh, so that is the justification for misogyny then.
He killed his mom.
Simple as that.
Because he's not on his medication because the system canceled it.
And so he doesn't have the help and, you know, therapy and medication he needs.
And he finds out that his mom let somebody abuse him in his whole life.
Been like, wow, that's so fucking misogynist that he snapped like that.
This man's brain is Crisco.
You can't have characters, okay?
Having characters is evil.
It has to be about the fact that they're men and women.
Now, I don't know if that's the movie they intended to make,
but that's the movie they kind of made.
Whoa.
Now look, this is not like I take two of my joker review where I basically said it was
mediocre and too empty to be upset about.
It's all you pretty much said.
Pretty much is.
Doubling down on anything else.
I sincerely felt that the manner in which the film managed to be self-righteously bland
was worthy of a more in-depth elaboration.
And this was that.
He calls this an elaboration.
Oh my God, he doesn't he doesn't know what these words mean.
It's surprising to say the least.
I also don't think it was a film made lazily or with cynical intent.
It's very possible that all of these less than functional decisions that I've observed
were made with high-minded intentions and that Todd Phillips, etc.
and the other filmmakers have very detailed, heartfelt explanations for each one.
But the thing about explanations is, well, you want to take this one, Mr. J?
If you have to explain a joke, there is no joke.
Um, yeah, but that's so just because you don't understand it doesn't mean nobody
understands it, Bob.
He clearly doesn't want everyone as stupid as you.
Yeah.
I'm Bob and that's the big picture.
The only thing that's big about this picture is the size of the man that's telling it.
I am disappointed.
There's no apology at the end of the video.
Sorry, you watched this.
I'd appreciate that.
I think it'd be good for all of us.
That hurt my brain.
You did it.
We killed him.
Oh my God.
It wasn't easy.
Why is he like this?
I don't know.
Why can't he just be a normal person?
Why does he have to be just the worst thing on YouTube?
Someone chained him to a radiator and beat him with broccoli.
It was a particularly tough branch of broccoli.
No, please.
I died.
There's not much else to say.
We've killed him quite a few times at this point, and it's just the same shit.
In fairness, there was less of the crazy amount of loads of big words in one big set.
What was it?
Because he had a crazy one that made it into Godelb 2, because it was so out there.
We had to write it all down.
Didn't do it this time.
I like how this is written and edited by Bob Shipman.
That was an achievement.
I would not.
Put my name on anything that was remarkable.
Congratulations, Bob.
You did the bare minimum.
You wrote your video and you edited your video.
Congratulations.
You're a YouTuber, technically.
By technicality, you are a YouTuber.
Oh, thanks.
But anyway, we have a main course.
That was the small video.
We're doing more.
The thing is, Bob is tough not to pause.
This one is, dare I say it, a better video.
I have two and a half hours left before I have to do my other show.
I was going to say, just let me know when you want to hop out,
and then that'll be fine.
You made it through a whole movie about video.
You've earned the right.
Yeah, this is a channel called Nando versus Movies,
and what he does is look at a movie,
finds, let's say, a part of it that's lacking,
and he tries to make up for that with a sort of a re-edit suggestion.
He has one for Joker, and I guess I'm more interested in
what Wolf will think of his fixes.
Sorry?
Is this a good video or is this a bad video?
I'm not going to make that claim.
It'll be up to you.
Let's see how it goes, shall we?
We'll just check out what he has to say.
It looks like his eyes are pouring into my soul.
Yeah.
Stop looking at me like that.
Also, who needs to go on lists?
Come on, man.
I don't know.
There's something about this guy.
Something's up.
Heaven's Gate Cult territory.
Can I just hear the pouring of you?
All right.
Oh, God.
He could be cry five, and I would believe it.
Look at Jay.
You're covering Nando?
He's a good.
All right, all right, all right.
Let's check it out.
Hi.
I just wanted to say two things.
First, this video is full of spoilers for the movie Joker,
which should not be a huge surprise,
since this video is about the movie Joker.
But still, I figured it was worth saying.
Second, at the end of this video,
I'm going to talk about a couple things that are important to me.
So even if you don't usually watch the entire video,
I'd really appreciate it if you did this time.
Okay.
Cyanide is important.
That's his business, no take.
Oh, my goodness.
Before we get started, I've got to give Joker some credit.
Joaquin Phoenix did a phenomenal job with Arthur.
From the voice, to the mannerisms, to the laugh,
he completely sold the character and deserves all of the praise he's getting.
Hilder Gunadotter's score was also amazing.
And finally,
How do you pronounce her name?
I'm going to go ahead and say probably.
I have no idea.
I genuinely don't know how to pronounce her name.
I wish I did, but I looked at her last name and I was like,
Oh, I can't.
I'm not even going to try.
It has a bunch of like accents and shit.
I don't make sense to me.
All right.
Cyanide and cinematography did that thing that all good Batman movies need to do.
They made Gotham City into a character.
Seems like a cliche, but it is legitimately very important,
especially in this movie.
And I think Joker handled Gotham City very well.
With all that being said, I had quite a few problems with Joker.
Almost all of which stemmed from what I would argue was a pretty shallow script.
Joker takes swings, some complicated topics, but I think it misses almost all of them.
Why, why can't we have good things?
Joker takes swings and a lot of complicated topics and misses all of them.
That's what he said.
Quite the claim.
Why is it that all of the people who like The Last Jedi in this shit really hate this movie?
Why do you people exist?
I don't know if he liked TLJ honestly.
He might have.
Okay, well, hold on.
I'm going to look at this channel and I'm going to guess that he does.
I can't substantiate because I've never heard of him.
Well, Jay said he's a good channel.
Jay would know.
Jay, does he like TLJ?
Tell us.
Reveal to us.
He just said Nando.
No.
You were the chosen one.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's still looking still.
He doesn't have many videos.
Actually, he doesn't have anything on TLJ.
No, he does.
Apparently, he did not like it.
That's it.
Apparently, he didn't like it.
Apparently, he didn't like it.
It's okay.
Well, you're okay for now and I'll forgive you a little bit.
Three videos.
I'm just telling people why Aquaman's shits.
From what I would argue was a pretty shallow script.
Joker takes swings at some complicated topics,
but I think it misses almost all of them.
From mental health to corruption to society.
I think Joker raised...
Mental health, corruption, and society apparently missed all of them.
Oh my god.
Like, really?
I don't know, man.
Like, none of them.
Oh, apparently, there's a quote from him saying,
out of ways Star Wars the Last Jedi succeeded.
Jay, you lied to us.
Well, what do you know?
It's almost like there's a trend of certain people.
I guess that doesn't necessarily mean he liked it, right?
He could just be saying that he didn't like it,
but it is achieved stuff.
But it didn't succeed in any way.
It didn't succeed at all.
I don't know.
He didn't hate it.
He didn't like it.
Okay, he's middling on it.
It misses almost all of them.
From mental health to corruption to society.
I think Joker raises many issues that it is not prepared to adequately address.
And maybe my biggest individual issue with Joker concerns Arthur himself.
He holds extreme views, which he uses to justify his actions,
which would usually be a good thing.
I want a protagonist with strong beliefs, like Batman.
And especially if the protagonist is an anti-hero,
like how Han believes he got a look out.
Can we please stop mentioning Batman?
I'm talking about this fucking movie.
Everyone has to mention Batman.
Every single fucking time.
Everyone has a stupid opinion about this movie.
They bring up Batman.
He said that Joker has extreme views.
Is he referring to awful people should be killed as a view?
Guessing?
Doesn't he realize that the Joker actually has a character arc in this movie
and that he changes based on the information he's given?
It just reminded me of, I don't know if you've seen the Red Light Media video,
but Jay of Red Light Media, not Jay Exe said, you know,
Arthur starts out so downtrodden that his character has nowhere to go.
And then Mike is like, no.
And then he goes, what?
He goes, Joker.
He becomes Joker.
For yourself or even a villain, like how Thanos holds some pretty strong beliefs
about the universe and balance.
It is not a problem that Arthur believes that the rich and powerful are making life worse for
the rest of us.
And it is not a problem that he takes that belief to the extreme
and uses that belief to justify murder and inciting a riot.
That's good.
He comes to that belief later on in the movie, if you actually watch it,
because he says so many times, I don't care about politics.
I don't care about any of that stuff.
I just want to make people smile and laugh.
And then when he learns out the shit about his mom,
when he goes and connects Thomas Wayne, when he loses his medication,
when he loses his therapy, everything adds up.
If you actually watch the fucking movie and pay attention to the fucking movie,
you would know these things.
Who is this person so I can avoid their channel?
It's only two minutes.
We can give him a chance.
I don't know.
I'm waiting for qualifications.
I'm not going to be a lot here so far.
He's not moving, Bob.
I don't care.
I just when I hear this point, I'm like, did you watch it?
It's good that he holds the view that it's fine.
Oh, well, not good morally, but holds the views that the rich people are fucking up
the poor people and that's good enough reason to kill them.
I mean, I'm trying to think of like that at the end of the movie, though.
And he wasn't going to kill them.
He was going to kill himself.
And he makes that decision last minute when he realizes he can't kill himself.
And he's just like, fuck it.
And then he he kills Murray.
Yeah.
And he definitely has the line about like how you you all walk past me sort of thing.
And I think I'm going to let him speak for some more because I'm just like.
Yeah, it's a good way for a real person to act.
But it's good that Arthur has that reaction because it raises interesting questions.
However, I believe Joker fails when it comes to doing anything interesting with those questions.
It feels content with saying that people are bad and Arthur is bad.
And maybe he's right.
Who knows?
Who can they show why people are bad?
Maybe he's right that everyone's bad, but not everyone's even.
He literally spares somebody in this film for not being bad.
Oh, my God.
Do I have to watch this?
I'm sorry.
This is awful.
Why did you do this to us?
There's a lot of bad joke it takes.
This is.
We're 23 seconds.
Oh, no, we're 20 what 22 minutes or two minutes in a 23 minute video.
God damn it.
This is definitely an issue of like.
Come on.
The film wouldn't be saying everyone's bad.
There's a seed devoted to the idea that a good person gets spades.
I don't.
Here's Joker doesn't spend much time examining Arthur's books critically outside of Murray at
the very end of the movie.
Very briefly.
No one stands up to Arthur challenges his beliefs.
And I'm not saying nobody knows.
Nobody fucking knows because it's on fucking head.
Well, people that do stand up to him are they die because he kills them.
Not about I really want to ask this guy like, OK, so tell me what you believe Joker's beliefs
are and then conclude that nobody like I'm trying to figure out that the formula here
actually saying that he isn't challenged on his belief, his belief that what that society is
kind of shit right now and that didn't didn't Murray challenge his beliefs
right before he got his head blown off.
Well, he says he says it like it doesn't count very briefly.
Murray questions him and he's the only one to question him.
It's like, well, no shit.
It's because he doesn't know that he's a psychopath killer.
He reveals that right before he kills everyone.
I would actually argue that it's Murray's challenge that like crystallizes Joker.
The fact that he's the his him addressing Arthur like that made off a fucking pissed.
Yeah.
And Arthur's pretty much like an invisible invisible to everyone else.
So, of course, no one would challenge him because no one else fucking sees how no one
would have his his lunacy is growing and no one get this little person like an idiot.
And I'm not saying that every movie needs to be a debate where opposing views are presented
and a winner is decided, but it doesn't make the story pretty flat.
If the protagonist does not meet with any real opposition doesn't meet with any opposition,
any ideological foil, you know, like the one who told him to his face that not ever.
You don't know me, Joe.
Why are you people still count?
Well, it wasn't long enough.
People need to stop making videos.
Isn't like someone's just highlighted in chat.
Isn't the fact that people are ignoring him a part of it, a part of his issues
like he's not seen not right.
Then that's why dancing on the car at the end.
This is like a dream come true because he's the center of attention.
Challenged his views.
Are you saying that the audience needs like, let's look at we need someone to tell him
that mass murdering is bad.
We are so stupid that if we don't have someone telling us that mass murder is bad,
that it means that we're all going to become mass murderers because the people that don't like this
this movie are so stupid that they can't even understand what it was about in the first place.
Seems to be arguing for like interest level.
Like it's not interesting to not have a challenge just too shallow or whatever.
I'm just like, I don't agree.
Wolf is trying to get to the joke by your definition.
What movie has I want to see this guy give me a comparison.
If he's saying that the Joker is lacking these things,
show me one that isn't so I can see what your level of, you know, actual comprehension.
He's going to reference Taxi Driver and King of Comedy because that's what everyone does.
I'm sorry.
No ideological foil feels shallow.
Like let's look at Murray's exchange with Arthur for one second.
The most complete attempt Joker makes at calling Arthur out.
Murray says, are you finished?
I mean, it's so much self pity, Arthur.
It sounds like you're making excuses for killing those young men.
Not everybody.
And I'll tell you this, not everybody is awful.
My dinner was pretty great.
That's a good point.
And I wish one Joker spent more time with.
It could be said.
What do you mean?
Joker actually agrees with everyone's awful.
He says it.
Oh my God.
He spits someone's life for being kind.
And then he calls Murray out.
He says, yeah, I know not everyone's awful.
And then he's.
But look at you.
You brought me on here to make fun of me.
You know, he calls him out on his own hypocrisy.
Did we watch the same fucking movie, bro?
Part of.
I'm not sure what this guy's after.
We understand this better and better as we go along, I think.
You know, it's pretty great.
That's a good point.
And I wish one Joker spent more time with.
It could be said that Arthur is using self-pity as an excuse
to act without consequences.
However, Murray is the wrong messenger to deliver that message.
And this is where Joker's shallowness becomes an issue.
Because in Joker, everyone is awful.
Like no.
No, but carry on.
You're wrong.
But carry on cartoonish.
The woman on the bus is rude to Arthur.
That's not cartoonishly awful.
Plenty of parents want to keep people who look weird away from their kids.
Yeah.
And she gave him a sympathetic look after reading the card and figuring out,
oh, there's just something mentally wrong with nothing cartoonish about her.
That's you need to go to a bus stop and stare at somebody for a few seconds and see what happens.
Even though he's just trying to make the kid laugh.
Arthur so us is rude to Arthur, even though he's just trying to make the kid laugh.
Arthur's social worker doesn't listen to him.
Those kids.
Arthur's social worker doesn't listen to him.
That's the only thing we get to hear about that.
I dare say it's tad more complicated than that.
Good job is to listen and reflect on him and try and improve him when her job is getting
taken away with just as much as his medication is in a city that doesn't care about her or him.
She's very, it's supposed to reflect the idea.
Like the idea is like, oh, the therapist doesn't care about him.
We dealt with this with Jenny.
It's like, are you aware of like therapists that aren't even particularly great at their
jobs or therapists that aren't actually supposed to be doing these jobs?
She's a social worker and she's trying to be the person that can bring Joker back together.
Like from his mental breakdown, someone has someone who has had several therapists,
none of which really said anything more than the exact same things that you could just
find for free on a YouTube video.
This is a thing that happens.
Okay, therapists don't generally care.
Not everything is like goodwill hunting.
I'm sorry to break it to you.
Just like, um, and this is, this is his list of like, you see, um, these people don't.
Like this, this is a society that's ridiculous.
Like why is it, and Jenny said the same thing.
It was like, you could, Jenny actually said you could see one of these things happening.
You can't see all of them happening in like a small amount of time.
Society can suck, man.
And I hate the, we don't even have to use the word because it's too meme-y.
But, uh, yeah, also Jay Longbone shall return from what I understand.
Anyway, steal Arthur's sign and beat him up for seemingly no reason.
Arthur's, um, okay.
God damn.
I actually feel like kind of a dick at this point.
So just like you just raw got everything.
So have you guys ever heard of kids, uh, like delinquents doing something just to be mean
as a group?
Oh my God.
Just pull up, just pull up that video that you, uh, oh, did Anna leave?
Yeah, we've lost.
It was just me and, you know, well, oh, we got Jay Longbone back.
Hello.
Hello.
We lost you and Anna.
It was terrifying.
Molly, you can just pull up that video that you showed me in rags earlier.
Kid that like was getting beat up for like no reason.
And then he goes and beats up all the other kids.
Actually.
Yeah.
Let's I, you've made me want to actually do that.
Yeah.
See if I can find it.
Incredibly applicable here.
If you guys want to see like the best sense of justice ever, this is going to be it.
Do, uh, do you know where it is?
I'm trying to find it.
It was before.
It was because I remember sending you the pot hole one.
Oh, there it is.
I found it.
Okay.
Give me a second shot.
So the question is, would kids really be such means?
Would they really?
Let me, I'll give you the link to you guys as well.
Oh, unless you already post it.
Um, so this is the link.
No, I'm thinking I can put that back on.
Um, do you want to sync it up?
Yes.
Hold on.
I'll pull it up right now.
All right.
I'm on zero on the video.
Okay.
So, uh, oh, that doesn't look quite right.
Does it get, you still see the movie ball picture to me.
Um, all right.
Three, two, one, go.
Can you hear me?
Uh, give us, just give us a three seconds or so.
That was a fucking hard.
What he curb stumps the kid's face.
It's so satisfying.
So yeah, uh, kids can be assholes.
That's kind of the point we're getting back here.
And if they're in a group where they're encouraging each other to be even more
assholey, like look at the clown guy with the sign.
I'm going to distract him.
One of you knock the sign out of him and then we'll run with it.
If he fucking chases us, we'll knock him out with it.
Why the hell not?
Um, so the idea is like, why are they doing this?
The children have no motivation to do this.
Like, dude, I mean, it's just like, it's this,
they don't need a motivation.
If they feel like doing it, they'll do it just to fuck with you.
What about the dog in the dryer?
Do you guys remember seeing that video?
What?
Yeah.
This girl on it, like her Instagram, uh, like story thing, she did Instagram live
and she puts her dog in the dryer and she laughs about it.
Oh, fuck.
Do you remember the, the YouTuber as well?
Like spat on a dog.
Yeah, I remember covering that.
Yeah, I remember that.
I like that.
And we established this as a terrible city.
Like I said, it's worse than you just have these YouTubers who are like,
people aren't this made.
Why would you do this?
What kind of sheltered life do you live in?
Where you think that's exactly the point.
They don't know that bad stuff happens in the world because they're so fucking sheltered.
It's like, walk down a bad, you know, street and you're going to learn that not
everything's all sunshine and daisies real fast.
Yeah.
This guy's soundproof walls actually become really symbolic.
Arthur's social worker.
Those kids steal Arthur's sign and beat him up for seemingly no reason.
Arthur's boss blames Arthur for what happened to the sign.
Even though, why would Arthur steal a going out of business sign?
Arthur's coworker lies about giving Arthur the gun.
Thomas Wayne is a jerk.
Wait, is that like something that he thinks shouldn't have happened?
The lying about giving the gun thing.
He says it like, is he just labeling things that are bad now?
I don't know.
Like, I'm just.
Look, okay.
So if you, I was going to say, like, what the fuck would you admit to that?
Like he's fucking dangerous.
It'd be even worse nowadays with all the gun control shit.
Like if you're passing guns around people like, you know, you're fired.
Get the fuck out.
That's that's going to scare people.
And yeah, you not only did that, he also said that he claimed that Arthur tried to buy the
gun off him, right?
Like he double screwed him.
I think did he say buy the gun or buy the bullets?
I can't remember.
Oh, I guess it doesn't really matter.
Because I think he says, I think he said you tried to buy a gun off him a week ago.
The implication being he refused that gun and then Joker got one from somewhere else.
That sort of thing.
Um.
Apparently, I'm being told we shouldn't be making arguments that these things happen
in real life and thus they're okay to happen in the film.
We should be arguing in universe.
Okay, so are you just gonna let's be nice, right?
So there are human beings in this film being.
No, no, we're not going to be nice.
This is this is like really retarded point.
It's fucking Gotham.
It's one of the most violent crime ridden places in fucking fiction that like you can't.
You can't compare it to reality yet.
You're fucking right because Gotham is worse than real life.
Well, here's the thing.
Like what can you name one thing that happens in this movie that is unrealistic to real life?
Uh, riots, they only happen in 2000s plus.
Sorry, it's a bad point because we're talking about human beings in this film being depicted.
We're drawing real life references to what human beings do and say and act.
There's a reason why so if you go strictly from in universe rules,
then we have to start wondering, so is this species human?
I don't know.
They haven't declared that in the film yet.
Obviously, we take stuff from real life in order to apply rules.
What fiction needs to do is tell us when they deviate from real life
if they're depicting something close to it.
So like if you have a fictional world like Looper, for example,
everything is mostly the same except there's time travel and people have telekinesis.
And so they do they try and establish that very quickly because everything else is the same.
You'll understand everything else.
Just make sure you get those things.
So the idea that it's like people aren't this mean.
It's like, yes, they are.
That's that's that's the point where they kids you can't appeal to real life
and call this unrealistic because life is this cruel as well.
But we wouldn't say the film is good because it's depicting people being mean
and people are mean in real life.
That's not the argument we're making.
We're just trying to establish that saying it's unrealistic is inaccurate.
Yep.
And you can absolutely appeal to real life if you're trying to define
whether or not something is possible in a film that's essentially grounded.
That's kind of where I was going with that.
There's a principle you can apply to lots of different things like that.
Like I said, Lord of the Rings is in trouble because it's almost all
without understanding what life is.
The only thing you really retain is stuff like Lord of the Rings.
It's like, oh, well, character people work a certain way like they do in real life.
And so you need to be realistic.
It's like, oh, so it's on Lord of the Rings to explain fucking everything.
Like you got what are all the species?
How do they all hang out?
Where all the places where all the rules or the borders?
What's all the powers?
It's like, yeah, that's why you need to be a fucking great writer
to get all of that shit sorted before you can even start telling a story.
Wolf, do you know of Lord of the Rings?
I think you'd like it.
Yes, I do know of it.
Oh, sweet.
Do you know of the Hobbit movies?
I think you'd like it.
Unfortunately.
Anyway, lies about giving Arthur the gun.
Thomas Wayne is a jerk.
He hits Arthur and possibly.
Okay, let's do this one too.
So you find out that a crazy man came to your house.
He put his hands in your child's mouth and he strangled almost to death your butler.
And then he comes to you personally and says, daddy.
Uh, I mean.
Oh, my God.
Not saying that Thomas Wayne isn't a jerk in this film.
That's fine.
I don't mind that.
But the idea that he punched him for like no reason or something.
It's like this.
There's a reason.
The fact that he only punched him should say a lot about Thomas Wayne's restraint.
Yeah, he could have arrested.
He talked to him for a minute or two.
He explained to him that his mom, you know, was not telling him the truth.
And he got his buttons pushed and then he punched him.
It's like, come on, context, dude.
You have to have the context there.
And yeah, because this is all you get.
Go ahead.
I was going to say, you think you get his bodyguards to take him outside and beat the
shit out of him for a little while.
And this is all to aid in the idea that the world is like cartoonishly cruel or whatever.
Oh, my.
Um, the idea of the world is cartoonishly cruel.
But it's just like, no, you've highlighted a bunch of things that make sense.
So there's the gun left.
Thomas Wayne is the jerk.
He hits Arthur and possibly lies about being Arthur's father.
Murray makes fun of Arthur, an aspiring standup comedian at an open mic who clearly has some
sort of mental health or neurological issues.
It's not clear at all.
And I don't know.
Is it so does it make you cruel to consume and critique someone else's work?
Because I don't know, guys.
I don't know.
What are we doing right now?
We're saying only if you criticize someone, you are the embodiment of Satan.
Well, we did drive tonaled off the Internet.
Guess we are.
I actually am so sad about that.
Still tonaled.
Come back.
You're my favorite person on the face of YouTube.
I need you to come back.
Come back on national television.
And Arthur's mom may have lied to Arthur about his father on top of all of that.
Why does he keep saying may have for these things?
We know the answer.
So this is what I've heard online.
So if you say if you cite the papers at Arkham, they say that Thomas Wayne could have paid
to have them doctored.
Based off of what?
The fact that he's rich and evil.
Yeah, I mean, some people have theories that she like they did fuck and then it did result
in the kid, but the kid was fucked up.
Thomas Wayne wasn't fucking with a mentally ill kid like it.
And then like, no, you don't you take the kid crazy lady and then fuck off.
And that's some theories I've heard.
I mean, I just I don't think.
I need to watch the film again to get a full refresh, but whatever.
That's not the point he's making right now.
Anyway, he's trying to say that everything's mean and it I guess I'm waiting for him to
say like it's unrealistic or something out his father and on top of all of that.
And I know how dumb this sounds, but society seems to have left Arthur behind.
Oh, wow.
Be like the point of the movie.
The mental health program is shut down.
There's a garbage strike, super rats and out of touch.
Plutocrat is running for mayor and the citizens of Gotham has become a violent mob.
Everyone is awful.
And that gives Joker an excuse not to question Arthur's beliefs.
It's too simple.
An interesting way.
So like the problem is that it's implied that he just doesn't know what he's doing.
The problem is that it's implied that he just should start shooting people.
Is that what he's trying to say?
Like, oh, he concludes after all of this.
Yeah, he's just going to start shooting people live on air.
He's going to incite riots and the film isn't saying anything about how wrong that is.
It's like, I mean, I've got some arguments for why those sorts of things could end badly.
But this is kind of where I'm at in terms of this movie being it doesn't want to take
a side and definitively claim that either the people or the rich, the classified,
like one of them is right because I don't I think the film's point is that neither of them are right.
And so the idea that he's not challenged enough is Thomas Wayne challenged enough
because he was killed accounts as some form of a challenge, right?
Only in your subjectively objective opinion.
All right, an interesting movie would feature a more complex society and it's easy to compare
Joker to the two movies that it's clearly borrowing a lot of its themes and visuals
and actors from my taxi drive.
Hey, it's like Bingo at this point.
So if I was actually doing it, you know, when I did.
Okay, go ahead.
At this point, I've never seen King of Comedy.
I've never seen Taxi Driver.
I don't even really know too much of Scorsese's works.
But at this point, it's like I'm going to like probably hate this movie or these movies
just like to spite these people.
They keep getting brought up.
I mean, I watched comedy and I didn't like it, but I'm not I do not like Scorsese movies.
And I was told the only reason I watched came in comedy was because I was told
that this movie seemed like it was going to be a similar plot.
And while there's, you know, similar things about it, I feel like the Joker is different enough.
Um, reminds me of I like the both of them.
I think that they're very strong.
I actually would say that Taxi Driver is better than I like it.
And what I mean by that is I don't like it as much as I think it is very good.
I just it doesn't I don't respond very well to Travis Bickle as a character.
I don't really like him.
It's kind of like Daenerys up until season eight where I was like,
I think she's perfectly well written.
I just don't like her.
And you might be like, you like Joker?
Like, yeah, I kind of like Arthur.
I can I can see how all of it worked out.
And I think that there could have been a good guy there.
I don't really feel the same way about Travis Bickle,
but that's a whole other fucking conversation.
Same for Rupert Pupkin, by the way.
He's the character from King of Comedy.
King of Comedy.
We need more, you know, like how I reference A New Hope.
I reference the shit out of it when I'm talking about TFA copying it
because there are like specific events.
And like, at the point I'm trying to make in my TFA series was that they copy them,
but then they don't copy the mechanics that led to these events.
And so their story is like, where's for it?
Because they're kind of like the parrot thing that Movie Bob was saying,
where you you take the parts that everyone remembers and you put them in yours,
but you don't earn your way there.
And so you just got this hollow copy.
And that's what a lot of people feel about TFA.
And I think it's very provable with Taxi Driver and King of Comedy.
The best people have is King of Comedy,
a guy who wants to be on a TV show that's very comedy focused.
It's like, oh, like how Arthur wants to get a Murray show rip off.
It's like, you've got to be more specific than that.
That's way too fucking broad.
Taxi Driver, a guy who is well, I was going to say down in his luck.
He's not really he chooses.
He's actually quite rich.
He admits to this.
Well, not rich, but he's got a lot of funds he doesn't know what to do with.
He's a taxi driver that works a lot of hours.
He's in a world that he sees as like disgusting and depraved.
But he only views the world from specific angles.
Like he goes to the depraved areas.
He goes out at night.
So he's very biased.
And he gets there's a lot of complicated elements to a two taxi driver
that I probably shouldn't go into right now.
We'll save it for when we go over a bigger podcast about these two films
and how Joker's not a fucking rip off of them.
But my issue is, it's just like they usually go surface level with how it's a clone.
And it's really bothering me because I feel like you should put a lot more effort
in than just fucking echoing what every single other person fucking says, which is.
Joe's like taxi driver.
Joe's like a comedy.
Now he might do right.
So we'll give him a shot here.
But I've seen the both of these films and I know them relatively well.
So we should be able to survive this portion of the video.
And visuals and actors.
Well, what I meant, by the way, by the not down on his luck
is that Arthur totally is to an extreme degree.
They're not in the same situation.
They're not in the same cities.
That's kind of where I was going with that from taxi driver and the king of comedy.
Both Scorsese masterpieces about an out of touch loner and society.
However, I think both of those movies do something very specific.
The Joker does not something that helps to explore the beliefs of the protagonist.
They're valuing way.
So that brings me to my one small change.
I believe Joker could easily introduce a character who is not awful.
Doesn't have to be perfect.
I can't with these.
I can't with these stupid takes.
All right.
We're going to let him continue, but we will we will put a notation.
We will put a notation.
There is a seed that explicitly states there is a Goodman and he is spared because he is a Goodman.
Just putting it out there.
I'm going to let you continue.
That's a footnote.
Who is not awful?
Doesn't have to be perfect.
Just someone that can call him on his B.S.
We can use that character to learn more about Arthur and society.
Get a more nuanced view on all of the themes of the movie.
In Taxi Driver, this character is Betsy played by Civil Shepherd.
The Palentine and Joker.
It's Robert De Niro and Gary.
So almost like you didn't watch the movie.
You simpleton.
It's like they want Joe.
It's like they want Joker to have some kind of fucking sidekick,
like some kooky sidekick who makes jokes and shit.
Come on, man.
Go talk to the girl, man.
Stop stalking her, man.
Yeah.
For reference for you guys, she's working on Palentine's goal to become local.
I think he might be running for president.
I can't remember.
It doesn't matter.
He stalks her at first, Travis Bickle, and then he asks her out.
They talk about a lot of different things.
They go on a date.
He takes her on a date to see a porno.
And she's like, what the fuck?
And then she doesn't want to talk to him ever again
because she realizes he's a fucking freak
or doesn't understand social cues to a degree.
Let's put it that way.
And he doesn't get it.
Like there's this conversation in the film where he's like,
don't people go to see stuff like this?
And it's just because he's got a very warped view of reality.
I don't know if I go as far as saying she really calls out his ideas.
There's no real debate between them.
He gets to the point where he fucking hates her
and it's very irrational because he's a very complicated person.
I don't know if I'd describe it as she's his opposite in the film.
There's certain bits of dialogue that I'd say are challenging his ideas,
but I'm also curious what exactly he means by having a character that...
What would this theoretical character talk to Joker about?
Like you realize society isn't that bad, right?
He'd be like, okay, thanks.
Like Arthur, you realize there's a lot of good people out there, Arthur.
And he's just like, great.
I look forward to meeting them one day.
Travis Pickle.
Bickle, Bickle.
But Travis Pickle.
This is the thing.
Like this is very...
I guess half-baked would be the choice of words I'd have.
I'm still...
Maybe he's going to explain it.
I'll just let him carry on.
...who Travis courts, goes on a date with, and then embarrasses himself in front of.
Taxi Driver is about this dirty, disgusting version of New York that Travis hates and wants to clean up.
And that belief isn't necessarily held by Betsy,
but she is also working for a politician who wants to make changes.
So she represents the idea of change.
And her and Travis get along until she exposes the contradiction at the heart of Travis.
He thinks New York is a dirty, disgusting mess that he also participates in.
He takes her to the pornographic movie theater on a date,
and that highlights the fact that Travis takes part in this system that he believes needs to be destroyed.
I don't know that to a degree, sure, but it's also...
Travis doesn't understand what's wrong.
This is very explicit.
He's like, this is something that people do.
And then even on their way into the show or movie, she's like, are we going to see a normal movie?
And then he's like, no, no, no, and he literally says, I see couples seeing this stuff all the time.
He's based how he operates in society from what he's seen,
while simultaneously not realizing that all he views is the underbelly sort of thing.
But I'm still curious where he's going with this, exactly.
That's why he can't go on a date with and have a normal relationship with Betsy.
It's the internal contradiction of Travis Bickle,
and you can only get at that with a character like Betsy.
I didn't get at that through here. It was through the movie.
You see him make a lot of decisions that push him into that direct.
I feel bad, obviously, because you...
I'm assuming all three of you haven't seen Taxi Driver,
so I'm the only one who can really comment on this portion.
Uh, I've seen it, but it was like a long time ago, like when I was a kid.
You watched this as a kid?
Yeah.
I guess, in fairness, I watched Alien when I was a kid.
Yeah, I watched a lot of shit.
It traumatized me.
Yeah, the point being is that you can tell by watching the film
that he's a contradictive human being.
Uh, he has a lot of harsh views that aren't exactly fueled by anything strictly coherent.
It's a, like I said, it's a really good film.
I just don't, um, I don't agree that Joker is improved by having a character that tells him,
hey, maybe you shouldn't hate society as much as you do because it's not all bad.
I don't, I don't know, I don't understand how Joker benefits from that.
Who exists outside of that world and can highlight Travis's contradiction.
The same can be said of Diane Abbott's Rita Keene in the King of Comedy.
In the King of Comedy, Robert De Niro plays Rupert Pumpkin, an aspiring stan-
Ohhhh.
But he's a stalker in that movie.
Rupert Pupkin.
His name is Pupkin and there's a joke in the film where everyone pronounces his name wrong
and one of the wrong pronunciations is pumpkin and he just said pumpkin.
Damn you, you're supposed to pay attention.
His name is Rupert Pupkin.
It's okay, but yeah, um, I guess, yeah, we'll see what his description of this is.
Outside of that world and can highlight Travis's contradiction,
the same can be said of Diane Abbott's Rita Keene in the King of Comedy.
In the King of Comedy, Robert De Niro plays Rupert Pumpkin, an aspiring stand-up comedian
who is obsessed with talk show host Jerry Langford and wants to be on his show.
And Rupert both desperately wants to be a stand-up comedian
but does not want to do the work necessary to be a stand-up comedian.
He's very determined when it comes to things like sitting in offices
and making sure people get tapes.
Doesn't he, um, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure like the opening time
he talks to Jerry explains that he's been doing all of the shows and he's not getting anywhere.
Yeah, he does and he records his little tapes so that way he can send them out to places
and he's tired of just doing that because he hasn't gotten noticed.
So that's why he goes to the office.
That's why he's that persistent.
That's why he becomes a stalker because he can't make it the regular route
that everyone is telling him to.
And that's one of the things that he insists on even at the end of the movie
when he finally goes on the show.
And he's like, the only reason I'm here is because I have this guy held up at gunpoint.
You all are laughing now, but you're going to freak out when you find out that it's true
because I did everything right and that didn't work.
So I had to go to these extremes to make this happen.
And then he writes a book about it and he becomes famous after he gets out of prison.
Did this guy not watch this movie either?
I just like he's, uh, I think he's trying to slightly twist both of the films to really
solidly present the argument that the presence of a character that contradicts them is what
made them strong or something like that.
But like, I'm already rushing ahead in my head here.
Like, um, the character that Rita plays, uh, she, she's not really in this film that much.
She's almost like a tag along.
Basically, for reference for the people who haven't seen this film, he, um, he tells
this girl from high school that he's like super famous and doing great.
When he's not, he's doing terribly.
And then, um, he imagines a conversation with the TV host and I'm pretty sure we are, um,
we see, we see him imagine it.
He's like talking to, um, he's like, he's a fair member.
He's like in an office with Jerry and they're like really good friends suddenly.
And they're discussing how he's going to go to his mansion.
And it makes no sense at all.
Like in terms of continuity, because Jerry doesn't even want to get anywhere near him.
And so you're like, Oh, this is fucking, this is in his head.
And then we later see him invite, uh, that character to Jerry's mansion or whatever it is.
And they go there and Jerry's like, what the fuck are you doing here?
Like you've just come into my house uninvited because he gets in through like a servant,
I guess.
And the, and the idea that the girl is there to challenge him doesn't even make much sense
to me because Jerry is directly challenging him.
He's shouting at him for imagining all this shit.
You know, she just, she's only there to basically be like, Hey, this is fucked up.
We shouldn't have just helped her.
Just apologize.
It's like, I'm sorry, we'll leave.
You know,
someone in chat said Rupert was lying.
He never performed anywhere.
I don't know that we can say that definitively.
Can we?
We don't have any proof of that.
He just, because they don't go to show flashbacks or anything.
He just says that he's been doing it for a long time.
Yeah.
I don't, I don't know.
I don't know that we can, I don't know if we can be definitive either way on that one,
but, uh, it's possible
that he's not determined when it comes to working in comedy clubs and getting there,
the way all the rest of the comedians do.
He instead likes to pretend he's already a part of that world.
And that's where Diane Abbott's Rita comes in.
An old friend from high school who Rupert goes on a date with.
And during the date, he lies to her about being friends with Jerry,
where a character like Sandra Bernard's Masha exists within this diluted celebrity obsessed world.
Rita exists outside of it.
And when Rupert does something pretty bizarre,
like goes to Jerry Langford's house unannounced,
Reed is able to call out how strange that is.
Okay. Do you see how many people were present in that screenshot?
They're all fucking calling him out, basically.
Reed is able to housekeeper people and you've got Jerry here and they're all like,
you're kind of insane having her say it.
Honestly, it's kind of less meaningful for her to say it than Jerry
because Jerry is the one that he imagined the conversation with.
So to have him directly tell him, and he does, by the way,
he doesn't fucking listen to him.
I don't even, this isn't really even what he's saying it is,
like the idea that it provides a counter ideologically to the character's viewpoint.
He denies all of it anyway.
He finds Jerry's being extremely rude and that the girl is sort of like,
I can't remember specifically, but he's not, this doesn't convince him.
Pumpkin follows through throughout the whole film.
There's never a point where he thinks, you know what, maybe I'm wrong.
He literally fucking kidnaps the guy by the end of the film.
The only part where he kind of changes is when the guy tells him,
I only told you, like, I'll listen to your tape to get rid of you.
Right. Yeah.
Which that doesn't make him better.
It makes him worse.
But yeah, so it's these.
This is kind of where I'm at right now in terms of discussing
Taxi Driver, King of Comedy and Joker.
They are so fucking different.
And so you have these people being like, I just kind of ripped stuff out of them.
And I'm like, what specific stuff are you talking about?
Like, these are very different characters in very different worlds with very different problems.
Because the idea is that because Pumpkin has imagined stuff,
just like Joker imagined the girlfriend.
See, that's kind of, you see what I mean?
And before anyone assumes anything,
I'm not putting all of these arguments into this guy's video.
I'm just saying this is all stuff I've heard around these films.
So far, the only problem I've got with his assessment is that he's,
I don't know, missing a couple of things out of both these movies.
I'm more curious how he's going to get to back to Joker, I guess.
Reality check.
Who can call Rupert on his contradiction?
So if I could make one small change to Joker, I would introduce a character into the movie.
Well, that's not exactly right.
I would not unintroduce a character.
Sophie, played by Zazie Beets, would not spend most of the movie as a hallucination.
She would be actually dating Arthur.
For those who don't remember.
What reason would she have to do that?
Oh my god.
I like that we're already stuck.
Excuse me, sir.
You're rewrite.
We have an issue.
Okay, well, we'll let him continue.
Because let's just imagine for a second that she's just dating him from the get go.
We don't even know why they're just a happy couple,
which changes a lot about this film, but okay, that's the case.
For those who don't remember, or people who haven't seen Joker but don't care,
Sophie is a seemingly single mother who lives in Arthur's building.
After a brief, friendly interaction, Arthur follows Sophie to her job at the bank,
then she shows up unannounced at Arthur's apartment,
is remarkably cool with being stalked, goes with Arthur to his open mic night,
goes on another date with Arthur, meets Arthur at the hospital,
and even does other things.
But then Arthur goes to Sophie's apartment,
and it is revealed that Arthur was imagining their interactions.
The nice girl didn't actually like him.
Cue dumb flashback.
Then maybe-
Oh, that's another one for the bingo board people.
Everybody thinks the flashbacks are dumb.
Um, they're like knocking you over the head as if we couldn't figure it out.
I'm always just like this, this-
I, I, and I still stand by what I said the last time I was on.
That, yeah, I mean, I wish I said it the last time.
The amount of people that still to this day think that the Eagles are a plot hole
in the Lord of the Rings is proof enough that you need to explain this shit.
Because the amount of people that pretend that they're smart enough to get this
still don't get all this shit.
It's, first off, I mean, if it took away from the film, that would be one thing.
But it doesn't take away from anything.
And also, you just, I'm already realizing you have to get that this story no longer works.
You have to get, you have to have her get killed, kidnapped, or she leaves him.
You have to have one of those things happen now.
Because he can't have her and simultaneously hate the world.
Because there's a good chance, especially if they're in a hell of like a,
not a healthy relationship, but a relationship that's working enough that they're together.
Then he's gonna find comfort in here, isn't he?
Like, there's gonna be why they're together.
So doesn't that like severely alter this film to like a drastic degree?
I guess it kind of wanted, he wanted to be kind of like that animated killing drug movie
where he had a kid and a wife and then he loses it and then he goes crazy, like, which is cliche.
Maybe he's about to do that in this rewrite, like she'll get killed or something.
That's all I'm expecting now, she's gonna get killed.
That'll be helpful because I actually just read the killing joke a few days ago, first time, so.
I haven't seen the movie, but people tell me not to.
So I think I'm gonna go with that.
Dumb moment, because Joker trades an interesting character,
who also happens to be one of two female main characters,
and the single main character of color for a lame reveal.
Oh, I don't know if you guys call that.
I'll just play it again, because that's not an argument.
Play what?
The video?
You dumb flashback.
Then maybe you don't have nothing played for me.
Oh, is it playing now?
No, hold on, I'm gonna refresh the page.
Okay.
There's no way this is a small change.
Yeah, you cannot call this a small change.
You back in?
Okay.
Imagining them.
Is that working?
Mr. Ford?
All right then.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
I don't know what happened.
Is it up for you now?
Uh, it's up.
Department, and it is revealed that Arthur was imagining their interactions.
The nice girl didn't actually like him.
Cute dumb flashback.
Then maybe he kills her.
Who knows?
It's an incredibly dumb moment, because Joker trades an interesting character.
What?
Happens to be one of two female main characters,
and the single main character of color for a lame reveal.
That's the reaction I was expecting.
That's his problem with it.
It's all it always comes down to.
So, like, he describes what happens in the film as dumb,
and then he proceeds to say that it's bad,
because she's one of the two main female characters,
and the only character of color who's a main character.
Oh, God.
So, like, just extending his logic out,
if you are a person of color and female, you should not be a hallucination.
I'm going to keep that in mind for a future reference.
Try not to be in someone's hallucination.
What a weird thing to say, but okay.
One of two female main characters,
and the single main character of color for a lame reveal.
It is both not worth it, and not particularly effective.
So, I'm going to walk you through how-
Yeah, because having her be his girlfriend
and being killed off, and that's what fuels his jokers.
And that's not cliche as fuck already.
That's what it is.
It's not boring as hell at all.
Honestly, I'd be surprised if a lot of the audience members were-
If, say, for example, this relationship was real,
like, her dying would almost seem like,
well, you got to do that.
She's going to get killed, I guess, because, you know, what else are you going to do?
Yeah, but it's one of those crowd-pleasing things with movies.
Well, we got to have, like, the male protagonist, like, die.
Well, he's got to have something to fight for, like, go crazy over,
and it's got to be a chick dying, or his kid dying.
It's the same shit.
It's like taken, but with Joker.
Hey, I'd watch that.
Fucking stop.
Joking.
Joking.
He's coming for all their lives, and they thought he was just joking.
Oh, my God.
I want to see a Photoshop of Liam Neeson with clown makeup now.
Yes.
Make it happen, everyone.
Yeah, also, I just wanted to point out, we just got-
I don't know, like, you had the misogynist take from Bob,
and now you've got, like, don't kill people of color.
It's like, why do the identity politics bleed right in randomly as well?
Like, that felt like it came out of nowhere.
No, it's not- don't kill her.
Like, don't hallucinate her.
That's-
It's rude to hallucinate.
No, kill her in real life.
That's what we want.
We asked, we soldier on.
Someone just separated the JOA from the QUIN and Joaquin's name
for joking would actually work.
It's really good.
I like that.
So I'm going to walk you through how making Sophie not a hallucination
would address quite a few of Joker's issues
and give you an idea of what this alternate version of Joker would look like.
So you have to start with the meat cute.
First thing, we need to slightly change the first encounter between Sophie and Arthur.
Since they are actually going to be dating,
there needs to be to demonstrate his value to Sophie.
Show her that he can be a good guy.
Give her a re-
Dude, you're changing his character now.
Apparently, Jay just had to Google it and it exists already.
What does?
Joking.
Liam Neeson is the Joker.
Oh my god.
Here we go.
That doesn't surprise me, to be honest with you.
I don't want to say those now.
It's not really good, but I mean, the fact that it already exists is all right.
What's with like-
Good on you.
Oh, it's done with like paint, I guess.
Okay.
Yeah.
What was the context for who made this?
They like Liam Neeson and the Joker.
I guess so.
It's very strange.
Besides just holding an elevator.
I think this one's easy.
Arthur can use his clown talents to-
I know he would say that stupid shit.
He can use his clown talents to woo the woman.
So, do you remember-
I get close to the sun and then I get them paintings.
Do you remember how she does the shot to the head and makes a sound,
and then outside the elevator, he goes,
Hey, like, you know, and she looks at him and then he does the same thing.
And she's just like, okay.
So like, he's not great with people.
He doesn't even understand why that would be interpreted as like a creepier thing to do.
He thought he was just sending back what she sent to him, you know?
It's perfectly fine.
The idea that we turn him into a person who could feasibly successfully
have a female be like, wow, you're awesome.
It's like, kind of changes his position.
But okay, let's see what else he's got.
Sophie's kid.
He's good with kids.
He does seem to be a genuinely good clown.
So Arthur makes the kid smile and brimming with confidence,
Arthur asks Sophie out to dinner.
She accepts.
First date, Arthur takes Sophie to a comedy club.
But in this version, he is not performing.
They are just there to see a comedian.
Harry Goldman, a comedian I love and have been following since the last comic standing days.
His HBO special, The Great Depression, is so funny.
I'm gonna ask you to head for all this.
End of non-plug.
But it's a good date.
He has to put his hands in the water!
He sounds so much worse than the one that we actually watched.
That felt odd, but all right.
So The Great Depression is so funny.
End of non-plug.
And it's a good date.
Like, in real life, with the right comedian,
comedy club can be a great first date.
Especially for Arthur, because this is where he spends a lot of his time.
People know him.
And Arthur shares.
Do you think people know him?
And like, he's changing the movie.
Arthur's got this whole selection of people
that are having good times with in the fucking comedy club.
But he hates the world.
Like, this would make any sense.
We need to disconnect him from all of these things.
That's the point.
Like, these people just don't want a movie about the Joker.
They want a feel-good movie where at the end, he becomes a good person.
Keep it going, I guess.
It's this dream of being a comedian with Sophie.
And she's encouraging.
Maybe he can do it someday.
Now there's a balance.
Arthur's fired.
Things around him are going poorly.
But Sophie's giving Arthur some hope.
Now second date.
I like the idea of Sophie going to the open mic with Arthur.
Maybe he bombs in the beginning, but not quite as badly.
It goes fine.
And Sophie's supportive.
He just needs practice.
And Arthur kind of gets that.
He's doing OK.
But then we get the Thomas Wayne revelation.
And before Arthur confronts his mom, he tells Sophie.
Sophie tells him to drop it.
Take it from a single mother.
Why would you come with it?
What do you mean take it from a single mother?
What is that supposed to mean?
Oh, so he just basically wants like a dark romantic tragedy movie.
That's what he wants.
I didn't sign up to watch that movie.
I don't want to watch this.
It's a different movie.
Such a fucking champion for women.
But it's like she's only used some kind of talisman for him.
Like, oh, she died.
It's just cool for him to explore a different type of relationship.
I need to find out is Joker still in theaters
because I kind of want to watch it again just to spite these people.
I got like I'll do it.
Like fourth time watching the movie.
Fine.
Okay, I guess Google doesn't want to work for me right now.
Damn you, Google.
I'm going to go grab some food.
I'll be right back.
I love how he doesn't even include Arthur's mental illness
and how like the girlfriend would deal with that
and how she would like respond to it.
It's all about, well, it's kind of awkward.
Like the way he describes it, like Arthur's just kind of awkward.
And that's it.
It does actually sound like a darker, romantic comedy.
Like you see the trailer is like, I love you.
I love you too.
Like really crappy musicals like this is like in his job.
And then it's like, you're fired.
And he's like, no.
And then the date with the girl, he's like, you're fired.
And then, you know, I'm just picturing this super generic film,
which is not what this was going for.
This Sophie brings perspective to Arthur.
He needs to move.
So a part of the reason why Arthur does what he does
is because he doesn't have full perspective.
He doesn't understand fully what everybody's doing
and why they're doing it.
All he gets is the results and he's fucking tired of it.
And, you know, I don't think that he's necessarily wrong
for fucking hating all of the results that keep ending up.
But, you know, as the psychiatrist explains,
it's not like the whole world is out for him.
It's that it sucks for everybody,
but it doesn't fucking matter
because it's going to feel personal regardless.
Like the idea that we need this fucking goofy ass character
to be like, hey, man, it's, you know what?
Then shut up, okay.
All right.
Forward, but Arthur lies.
He can't help himself.
He tells his mother she ends up in the hospital.
And while Arthur is in the hospital,
Arthur's video shows up on the Murray Franklin show.
And now it's a nitpick, not unlike my podcast,
Mostly Nitpicking.
Please subscribe.
Oh my God, stop it.
More.
Oh my, 322 episodes.
All right.
Going strong.
What did I miss?
Nothing.
Nothing.
He plugged his podcast in and check it out.
Okay.
Check out his podcast.
A nitpick, not on my podcast.
What an unattractive name for a podcast.
Mostly nitpicking, like nitpicking.
Oh, they have an episode on the boys.
Oh, I don't want to see that shit.
I want to see that.
Please nitpicking.
Please subscribe.
This isn't a viral video kind of situation.
I don't think viral videos were a thing in the early age.
What makes you think this is a viral video?
Does that matter anyway?
It's Murray Franklin playing a clip on his show.
They're explaining in the fucking movie.
You guys see this.
This is really, this is really, really good.
Hmm.
Let's see.
Oh, no.
So creepy.
No theme.
Nothing.
Misogynist.
Pointless.
Joker's had enough of this society, man.
Can't deal with this.
The fucking movie bob looks like the hunchback of-
No.
Hunchback of Blob or Dom.
Oh, man.
I feel for Joker this image too.
Poor guy.
Okay.
Yeah, so I don't like this the way people are framing this.
It's not like a fucking YouTube video.
It's the 80s.
They don't have it.
It's like a person who runs a comedy show plays a clip from a stand-up comedian with a joke that
bombed and he's going to use it to burn the guy immediately after to cause hilarity with his
audience.
This is not impossible for the 80s, nor is it unheard of.
Can we please drop the whole reaction stuff as orderly now?
I mean, just see how memes exist now.
What you would call it back in the day is just like a running joke.
People would see something and they would just make a reference.
Where's the beef shit from the 80s?
People would parody that or repeat that because it's popular.
It's famous.
It doesn't have to be on fucking YouTube for that to happen.
But all right.
I want to die.
I want to die.
I mean, what did I ever wanted?
80s.
I don't even kind of understand how that happens at all.
Let's have Sophie have submitted the tape from the open mic.
Maybe why is that more believable?
Why would she submit a tape where he didn't get a good reaction?
It just sounds like she wants to humiliate it.
Like, honey, why did you give my tape to the guy on TV?
Because I love you, Joker.
Oh, so she's just as delusional as him then.
Okay.
Maybe.
I don't know if that's where he's going with this.
Is she because she's supposed to be the counter, right?
Okay.
Some sort of contest for aspiring stand-up comedians where if you send their video in
and they do well, Murray will have them on the show.
She sees Arthur set and she's like, Oh, maybe this is good enough.
So he established the people would enjoy you that much.
Like, maybe this is good.
Oh, my God.
Why would she wait until he delivers one that makes everyone laugh?
Like, what the fuck?
Actually, it makes it even funnier.
It makes it even funnier when you picture him like she sends in the tape and it like
they make fun of him and says she kill.
He kills her because
that's the move.
Fucking humiliated me.
He doesn't even try to kill Murray.
He just goes straight there.
Like, why the fuck would you do it?
He goes on Murray's show.
Murray's like, why did that bitch of a girlfriend send that video in?
He's like, I don't know.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
What is this?
I don't know.
It's a rewrite.
Accept it.
It's a rewrite.
Oh, my God.
I hope he never becomes a writer ever.
I hope he hones his craft.
Like some people some people just shouldn't do the things you want to do.
OK, sometimes you're just not good at it and you need to accept it.
I'm sorry.
He can aspire to be better.
I just don't.
It's tough to be better than the joke.
Oh, here's the thing.
You can aspire all you want, but sometimes you just don't get the things you want.
Yeah, I'm on the show.
She sees Arthur set and she's like, oh, maybe this is good enough.
So she secretly sends this tape to Marie Frank.
Such a fucking bitch.
Like, what the hell?
This is horrible.
I see him going like, why the fuck did you send that tape?
Like he's just shaking his shit.
He just points at her.
Everything that's wrong with society is your fault.
OK.
No, no, no.
No, you're predominantly worse.
It was good.
It seems like a nice thing and it just seems more plausible.
But are seems more plausible.
No, less plausible.
Less plausible, more funny.
This man is going to make me laugh.
Nice thing.
And it just seems more plausible.
But Arthur sees his video on the show and he's made a fool of.
So he blames Sophie and they can get in a fight.
Oh, wait, wait, what happened?
They got into a fight.
They want.
Please tell me that she kills this one.
You know how much people would say that this movie was misogynist?
They oh, yeah.
She was just trying to help him.
And he killed her.
It's like we came up with a joke ending.
It might be that he's going with it.
I don't know.
We blame Sophie and they can get in a fight and she leaves.
And then Arthur goes and confronts Thomas Wayne.
He's spinning out of control.
Thomas tells Arthur that his mom was crazy.
This makes Arthur feel even worse.
Also, let's have some people recognize Arthur on the street from the Murray Franklin show
and make fun of him.
Show that there are some consequences to him being on TV.
But then Arthur gets a call from the Murray Franklin show
and learns that Murray wants to have him on.
This is just the film now.
So is that it?
That's his edit.
Maybe there's more to this, but I just.
The idea that he needed a girlfriend.
OK, let's see if he changes it to the girls.
This is huge.
What an opportunity.
This will be the first kiss between Arthur and Sophie.
Sophie and Arthur work together.
Wait, she's sorry.
I've clearly missed something.
Hang on.
Let's go back.
Let's go by the but then Arthur gets a call from the Murray Franklin show
and learns that someone in the chat said, how about another joke?
So Faye.
This is huge.
What an opportunity.
This will be the first kiss between Arthur and Sophie.
Sophie and Arthur work together on new.
Oh, so they have a fight.
She leaves.
He gets a call saying he's going on the show and they get back together and kiss.
So he did you leave out the entire part of him murdering people on the subway for harassing a
woman?
I don't know.
The problem is when you do a rewrite, you need to.
Tell us what you've kept.
I don't know what he's kept.
I don't.
He's dropped, apparently.
I'm guessing everything else stays the same.
But then if it does, I'm getting lost.
Mr. Mr. Nando.
Unity.
This will be the first kiss between Arthur and Sophie.
Sophie and Arthur work together on new material.
It's good.
I don't believe for a second that she would stay with him if he flipped out on it after
they just had a date for the first time.
You know what I mean?
That's a fucking as red flags go.
I mean, especially considering our nutty as he is, like he would flip out a little,
you know, be a little dynamic.
His flip out would be a little more dynamic than the usual person.
Because then you also have to think she's not only thinking about herself,
she's thinking about her child.
She's like, do I want this crazy person around my child?
It's going to flip out over something.
No, apparently this version of Sophie is an absolute retard.
She's a plot device in this one.
And you could be like, well, she's a plot device.
The other one I'd be like, no, she's like a full on character.
And the other one that has nothing to do with Arthur.
And she's freaked out by the the attempt at almost converting her into a plot device
for him is thwarted because it's not real.
Like, you know, I think it's much more meaningful than she's there to tell him.
Everything is good.
And then she wait, let's see.
Let's see what else he does.
I'm curious what else is going to happen to this film.
Now that she's back in it in Arthur and Sophie.
Sophie and Arthur work together on new material.
It's good stuff.
Arthur's happy.
But then Arthur finds the picture with Thomas Wayne on it.
So Arthur continues to investigate.
Hold on.
Well, I have something completely else to say about Sophie.
So he said that she sends in the tape thinking it's good to Murray Franklin,
which is what causes the outburst in the first place.
Now she's going to work with Arthur.
I mean, clearly, if she thought that the first tape was good,
she doesn't have a good gauge of what good comedy is.
Well, neither does he.
So why in the world, why in the world would they work together?
So she's fucking him over even more.
This is such a stupid.
I don't like this version.
She learns that she was committed to the asylum,
but he blames Thomas Wayne.
Wayne must have institutionalized Arthur's mother to keep the secret
and Arthur becomes even more obsessed with Thomas.
You know, I wonder if there's going to be like a Chris Stuckman situation with this
where he'll like cry over this.
Tell that to Zod snap neck.
Do you guys know the context for that?
I feel like Anna probably is at least.
Okay, good.
Fucking.
Sorry, what do you know about Chris Stuckman's rewrite for Batman is super bad?
No.
Oh, tell her, tell her.
Well, I mean, I don't know it word for word.
I just know the payoff part, which is I haven't really seen much.
I saw the reaction to the end of the video.
I haven't seen the actual video.
We should do an email.
We read a script out.
Love Fringy.
Because Fringy fucking loves this meme.
But so the idea is like, I think that he's written a seed where they like try to chastise each other
about Superman for not being like moral enough or whatever.
And it goes something along the lines of this, like a Superman says like the Batman is a hypocrite.
He's like trying to get justice through horrible means.
And then like Batman's response is like, tell that to Zod snap deck.
What?
No, no, that's not real.
He did that and he was proud of it first.
He was proud of it first.
And then when everyone heard it, he was like, oh, fuck, I just tried to bury it.
Yeah, I remember he.
Oh, God, he posted a video like like he was like he was.
Yeah, he was so proud of it.
He posted a video of him like reciting the lines.
And oh, God, this flat voice just reciting that bullshit is hilarious.
And there's a line in the video where he says something to the effect of,
and I wrote this in only 20 minutes, pretending that it was so much pretending
that it was so much better than what we actually got talking.
Stop talking.
You're not helping yourself.
Yeah, it was great.
Finding that out.
He's also he has this video that he's I think he's gotten rid of now,
but you can still find it on YouTube.
Just look for Chris Stuckman, Red Letter Media response or something like that.
Oh, but yeah, where he's like.
Yeah, I saw that.
Yeah, Red Let Media just said like we're because they have that new review series.
It's one of their first ones, I think.
And they're like, oh, look, we're sitting in a chair and we've got a red background.
We're like those pricks.
And then Rich Evans is like, which pricks?
He's like, you know, the pricks with the red background.
They just show like three icons.
One of them is like Albin Skeptic.
I think it's Jeremy Johns, Albin Skeptic and Chris Stuckman.
And it's a fucking joke.
Just you have a red background.
That's all he said.
And like he's got this video where he's like, I can't believe they did this.
Oh my God, he said he said he said he said I immediately removed them from my call
from my heroes page or some shit with heroes.
And then it's like he says quickly after that, like I wasn't mad or anything,
but impulse decision.
That means you were fucking mad.
You jackass Christ.
I wasn't I wasn't mad, though.
Genuinely, if I was called a prick by Rich Evans on a Red Let Media video,
I would feel like I've ascended.
It would be amazing.
Yeah.
Funny thing is, is that people in the comments of that video were like saying exactly that
it's that they would feel proud of the fact that they were insulted by him.
It's just wonderful.
The idea of Rich Evans calls you a prick, but he took it like really personally.
Anyway, he said he he said he DM'd him and said, are we good?
But it's funny because like fucking that's how being wolf met.
It's pretty much that.
Like, oh, OK, I'd read it to my Facebook.
Sorry anyway, Nando.
Carry on.
A secret and Arthur becomes even more obsessed with Thomas.
He writes jokes about killing Thomas and Arthur extrapolates that out and blames society for
everything that happened to his mother and him.
Then Arthur goes to Wayne Manor.
He acts weird around Bruce and Alfred.
And Arthur comes home and we get this big confrontation between Sophie and Arthur.
Arthur walks into the apartment.
He's so out of order.
Also, what's he confronting about his jokes?
Yeah, because didn't they just get back together?
Yeah, OK.
So he he already had the guy go confront Thomas Wayne, but it's like the scene that he's showing
with Bruce Wayne happened before.
So he's just like reediting the movie and adding and shit and getting things all jumble fucked up.
Like, really, dude, really?
You're taking something great and making it into shit.
Hey, man, he thinks it's better.
OK, it's fine.
And we get this big confrontation between Sophie and Arthur.
Arthur walks into the apartment, finds Sophie holding the joke book.
What the hell is this?
Where'd you find that?
She's holding a joke.
What the fuck is this?
It's like a joke book.
Where'd you find that?
It's like it's on the table.
OK.
All right.
Sorry.
I'll take this seriously.
What's going to happen to the apartment?
Find Sophie holding the joke book.
What the hell is this?
Where'd you find that?
I had an idea I wanted to write down.
But what is Thomas Wayne get when he crosses a society full of people?
He treats like trash.
He gets what he deserves.
That's not knock knock.
What?
It's the police.
Mrs. Wayne, your husband Thomas was killed by a drunk driver.
Thomas Wayne.
He just writes a bunch of blatant murder jokes.
OK, OK.
Took everything from my.
It's nice how these people really don't like this movie.
You you're trying to rewrite it and remove the subtlety from the film.
But you're telling the film that it's stupid.
OK.
And I fucking dialogue each and everything from my family.
Like this is not a fucking thing.
What does that remind you of a certain TV show?
Only me and you will get this because rags is currently away.
But that movie goes, tell me, tell me about you hate the bat symbol.
You took everything from me.
Yes, you're on par with Batwoman now.
Congressionations.
Yeah, for reference, anybody, go watch Efap react to episode six of Batwoman.
That's what we're talking about.
It's fucking hilarious.
The whole episode, all of it.
Nando may have been inspired by Batwoman.
I don't know.
Thomas Wayne took everything from my family.
And you have a chance to start over to be something.
I get in this vision.
Everything runs the same with the files, right?
So I guess Joker's angry that Thomas fired her still.
Is that what does he think something?
What does he mean by took everything?
I agree with you.
Exactly.
Okay, everything from my family.
And you have a chance to start over to be something.
And you're going to throw it all away.
I will never do anything because of him.
You're going to throw it away by telling her.
What is so bad about he was like, knock knock
off the way.
Your husband's dead lol.
I just feel like dude, dude, he's all that funny.
Honestly, I'm going to go to joke.
I don't know, but weird.
And you're going to throw it all away.
I will never be anything because of him.
Blame Thomas Wayne.
Blame society.
Blame the rats.
Blame me.
You don't understand what it's like to be abandoned.
To be on your own.
Get so much self.
Oh my God.
This is such garbage.
I got a I got a smirk throw all of this.
Who's like, okay, this is what we're dealing with super melodramatic
conversation between two characters that barely know each other, by the way.
Uh, as evidenced by the fact that she's about to do a diatribe about how she's
downtrodden from society, I guess, but it's not society's fault because that's,
that was his point, I think.
By the way, this doesn't happen in King of Comedy or Taxi Driver.
There's no scene where a character says your fundamental beliefs are incorrect.
Travis Bickle or Rupert Pupkin.
That's not, you get a character, your characters get angry, angry at them,
but you get that with Thomas Wayne and Murray.
So I don't, it's kind of what I mean by those references bugging me, but okay.
And it to be on your own gets so much self-pity,
but it's just an excuse for you to do whatever you want.
So selfish.
There's still hasn't been one fucking mention of his mental illness.
Also having a character calling him selfish at this moment.
Um, all right.
If I get this, I don't really know.
This is sludge.
It's a little bit, but it's just an excuse for you to do whatever you want.
So selfish.
And then Sophie leaves all we need.
Joker never examines this point of view.
Arthur definitely has.
What is the point of having a character challenge him?
If he's not going to consider the point of view, what the fuck's the point of it?
Is it the audience?
Are we supposed to go?
Oh, look, a character disagrees with murder.
Like, okay.
I mean, geez, man.
Like, just take out the mental illness and give him a girlfriend.
Fuck it.
Fuck it.
I don't know.
Yeah.
I don't know if he still has that.
This is the thing.
You didn't mention that part.
So I'm guessing it's the same and make it shit.
That's what this guy wants need.
Joker never examines this point of view.
Arthur definitely has problems.
He's alone.
He's broke.
Has some sort of serious neurological general mental health issues.
We don't know the names, bro.
He could have saved all the money that he had and just lived simply.
Your world building sucks, buddy.
They never talk about his financial situation at all.
He's not even worried about money when he does his job.
I know the mom is writing that she wants money,
but that's because she wants to live in a nicer neighborhood and a nicer apartment.
Arthur seems completely content where he lives.
You know, he doesn't seem like he's interested in material objects.
It seemed to me that he hated the idea of getting bailed out
by the Waynes that he wanted to do it himself.
Which by the way, when people say like he's a deplorable character,
I was like, I don't know.
He seemed to be providing for his mother,
which was something of a virtue to a degree, but okay.
Has some sort of serious neurological general mental health issues.
That the girlfriend is the mental problem.
Women, am I right?
Jay said what he's describing is what I'd expect
the director of the Hagova movies to write for a Joker movie.
Oh, Jay.
Jay, you're supposed to like him.
You're supposed to be the nice man.
But I mean, black single mother in the 80s, in the era of the welfare queen,
that's not easy.
Sophie is truly marginalized.
The kind of person that society really leaves behind.
But Sophie has a child to take care of.
Why are you saying this?
Like, it applies more to her than Joker at this point.
Like, she is left behind.
He, you know, she's the real Joker.
She's the real.
Sounds like he's trying to develop her into a character
that has been just as dislodged by society as he has.
But she's dealing with it in a better way.
And he's going to become the Joker.
She's the counterpoint.
You don't have to be a Joker, everyone.
It's like, OK, this is what I mean.
I'm waiting for him to tell me what this achieves.
Hopefully he does that.
Care of so she can't just pity herself.
Joker's about a lot of things.
Mental illness, society, guns.
Like, if Joker's about anything, it's a movie about a desperate.
Wait, did he even mention guns in this rewrite of his list?
Or is he talking about the actual movie at this point?
He's talking about the movie,
but they don't fucking prioritize.
It has a gun in it.
They don't talk about guns.
I want to hear that.
The kind of person that society really leaves behind.
But Sophie has a child to take care of,
so she can't just pity herself.
Joker's about a lot of things.
Mental illness, society, guns.
Like, if Joker's about-
What does he mean it's about guns?
There's guns in it.
Does he just try to make a comment on gun control?
Or the lethality of guns?
Because I don't think that many of us, you know,
thought that guns were placid items, but okay.
About anything, it's a movie about a desperate loner
who is given a gun and immediately becomes a violent murderer.
It's too much to talk about now,
but look up the trigger pulls the finger,
gives Joker a new meaning that I don't hear discussed nearly enough.
But at its core-
I need to hear that again.
You kind of lost me there.
Yeah.
Guns.
Like, if Joker's about anything,
it's a movie about a desperate loner who is given a gun
and immediately becomes a violent murderer.
It's too much to talk about-
Whoa!
All right, so the gun is for self-defense.
He loses his job thanks to having it,
and he does actually use it in self-defense.
He doesn't become a psychopathic murderer the second that he's provided the gun.
There are other things going-
Like, wow, that's a read, I guess.
Like, his first, like, real fucked up kill that might have been-
that was, like, unjust was when he stabbed that dude in the neck with a screwdriver.
Right, the guy he hunted down on the staircase,
most would argue, was pretty fucking harsh.
At least in that point, there's, like, at least a little bit of justification,
because all three of them are beating the shit out of him,
and he's just in a rage at that point.
So is it excessive? Yes.
Is it completely unjustified?
I don't think so, not completely.
You do get tried differently under law when you're in, like,
you're seeing red or you're in a fit of rage, right,
versus a cold-calculated murder, I believe.
Especially if you were attacked by the person.
Did you ever watch the movie A Time to Kill?
No, I don't think so.
Oh, it's so good.
It's with Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock, Samuel Jackson, and Kevin Spacey,
and, like, Keith or Sutherland and Donald Sutherland.
Came out in 1994.
So basically, it takes place in the South,
and Samuel Jackson's eight-year-old daughter gets raped by these, you know,
basically white supremacist rednecks.
And so they know that the guys are going to get off,
because they're in a really racist part of the South.
And so Samuel Jackson goes to Matthew McConaughey, who's a lawyer,
and he's like, are they going to get off?
And Samuel Jackson's like, yeah, they're going to get off.
They're going to maybe go to prison for, like, a few months,
and then they're going to get out.
And so Samuel Jackson goes and shoots them,
like, when they're on their way to court,
because, you know, they raped his eight-year-old daughter.
So he murders them in front of all these people.
He goes to jail, and Matthew McConaughey is defending him,
and his plea is that he's pleading insanity.
That Samuel Jackson murdered these guys
because of what they did to his daughter,
and it drove him to be insane.
And that's the whole thing that they're trying to prove,
is that he was temporarily insane because of that situation.
And so the case is them trying to say, no, he's not insane.
He did it.
It was premeditated versus him being insane.
It's really good.
Maybe you should watch it.
Yeah, you know, I'll pop it on the ever-growing list.
So, like, yeah, just coming back to the whole,
I think he's just trying to describe some form of a trope.
I guess he's trying to say that the Joker applies to it.
Let's just play this fully so you hear everything.
Joker's about anything.
It's a movie about a desperate loner who is given a gun
and immediately becomes a violent murderer.
It's too much to talk about now,
but look up, the trigger pulls the finger,
gives Joker a new meaning that I don't hear discussed
nearly enough.
Gives Joker a new meaning that I don't hear.
Maybe it's because no one else is stupid enough
to make this point, not even similar.
I don't think anyone would agree that Joker's that simple.
It's like, no, it's not just a film,
but a guy who gets a gun becomes a killer.
That's ridiculous.
Mallard, Mallard.
Guns have electrical signals that go into your brain
and make you kill people.
There's no other explanation.
Yeah, that's why I own guns.
And, you know, I have yet to kill people.
But, you know, that's a thing that these SJW think.
Well, I guess he's saying that I don't even entirely know.
He said that, like, gives the film new meaning.
Or, like, he said, if the Joker is about anything,
it's, and it's like, I don't like it when they do that.
I don't like it at all.
It's like, that's not what it is.
But also, Pikachu, one of our regular artistes, made this.
Oh, boy.
Let's see.
Aw.
That's the cutest I've ever looked.
Yes.
Yeah.
Oh, cute.
You can enjoy this for a little bit
before you go back to the pain.
Yay.
Aw.
So cute.
Pikachu's the resident cute drawing person.
Do you have purple hair?
Oh, yet now I do.
I say that.
We've got a couple of cute drawing people, actually.
But, yeah.
Anyway, I guess those are gonna go back to...
Also, yes.
I guess we should acknowledge Rags has been gone for a little bit.
He said he'd be back.
I guess he'll be spied.
All right.
But, yeah.
Just one last time.
Hear him say it again just to really make sure it's what he said.
Think it's a movie about a desperate lo-
Sorry.
Gotta go fair the back.
He has a child to take care of, so she can't just pity herself.
Joker's about a lot of things.
Mental illness.
Society.
Guns.
Like, if Joker's about anything, it's a movie about a desperate loner
who is given a gun and immediately becomes a violent murderer.
It's too much to talk about now, but look up.
The trigger pulls the finger, gives Joker a new meaning
that I don't hear discussed nearly enough.
But at its core-
The trigger pulls the finger.
I didn't quite catch that one.
The trigger pulls the finger.
All right.
Look up, trigger.
Pull the finger.
We can't talk about that right now,
because it's just too deep for you pleb bitches.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Ridiculous.
Okay.
Literally making the guns kill people, not people kill people argument.
I'm not even going to say what it is he's saying.
He doesn't spend seconds on it, so I guess it's not that-
I mean, the name alone, the trigger pulls the finger, implies quite a bit.
Right, right, yeah.
Ripbooky2988, did he off himself?
That's a meme, as far as I know, just to say that he's dead regularly.
Oh, so it's like the Brett Keane thing?
I think so.
Like, if anyone says a boogie has died, don't trust it until-
Well, I don't know.
I don't know what would make me trust it.
Until it shows up on Twitter, I guess.
I guess, yeah.
Apparently enough.
But at its core, Joker is about a man who cannot move forward
because he believes he is a victim.
Taxi driver-
Because he is-
He is a victim.
What the fuck?
But okay, carry on.
King of Comedy worked where Joker didn't
because they were able to take their protagonist to task.
Call him on his contradiction, because both characters are contradictions.
Travis Pickle hates the ugliness in New York City, but he also participates in it.
Rupert wants to be famous without doing any of the work he's determined, yet entitled.
He does do the work at the end.
He comes up with a comedy skit that's actually not too bad.
I remember I watched this film with Metal, and he was like,
oh, is this going to turn out to be really bad when he finally gets on stage?
And his jokes aren't too bad.
You're like, oh, these are okay.
And it's part of the point of the film, I think, that he-
What do we think about the results that-
Because he does go to jail because he kidnapped somebody to get the position he wanted,
but then he gains fans while he's in jail.
And then when he's finally out, he gets his own show just because of the fame.
And so there's something to think about there, I suppose, is what the show's trying to say.
A lot of people try and argue that both the endings of Taxi Driver and
King of Comedy are in the characters' heads.
But as far as I'm aware, Martin Scorsesean and I think one of the producers or writers
or something of Taxi Driver said that the ending is very much real.
It's not in his head.
And I think something similar goes the same with King of Comedy.
I'm not going to say that for sure, though.
I need to check on it.
But the idea that-
No, because King of Comedy comes out with a book on his whole-
Yeah.
People argue that that's all in his head.
I don't think so.
I think that was a message that-
I don't know.
I feel like based on the story that was trying to be told was that even when he goes up and he says
in front of everyone on stage and he's like, I had to do this.
You forced me to be this radical because you wouldn't listen to me.
You wouldn't give me the time of day.
So I had to force my hand and that's why I'm here.
And you guys are all laughing at my jokes.
And you guys are all going to be like even horror struck and laughing
after you find out that everything I'm telling you is true.
And I thought that was kind of a poetic justice for when he goes to prison,
he writes his book and he becomes even more famous because of what he did.
Sure.
I thought that was-
That's what I got from the movie.
And this is the thing, he's just concluded now.
By the way, Nando has practically said that his rewrite is just better than the movie.
And it's like, if you say so.
But the specific element he's looking for is a character that challenges these people.
But like, again, I don't even believe that actually happens in Taxi Driver.
And it kind of does in King of Comedy, but it has no effect on the character.
And like, it only happens in the same vein that you have somebody fucking shouting at him,
which these things happen in Joker.
So I just don't, I don't agree with him.
I don't follow through.
And I really feel like, you know, I'm cynical at this point.
The people referencing Taxi Driver or King of Comedy, I'm just like,
you're just doing this because this is the thing to do.
Like, as a video essayist, this is what you're supposed to do to sort of
flex your credentials, if you will.
Like, I know my films.
Stretch out your lame ass videos.
I gotta get those mid-rolls.
I gotta get those mid-rolls.
He's the same kind of guy, albeit a little more clumsily.
He wants to be popular and loved, like Rupert, as evidenced by the fantasy.
But he doesn't want to do stand-up.
Arthur just wants attention.
But he doesn't actually want it.
Because when Arthur gets the opportunity, the chance to be on national TV,
he doesn't see it as an opportunity.
He sees it as a problem.
Yeah, Murray's a jerk to Arthur.
But Arthur is still a wannabe stand-up comedian who is about to go on a national talk show.
Arthur and the movie never consider the fact that this could be a huge win for Arthur.
Arthur immediately decides that this is a bad thing.
His life is over.
And yeah, Arthur-
I think his life was already over before he got that call.
Wasn't it like everything was already falling apart?
And he saw the Murray show as just perfect for a platform for him to kill himself on.
Like, uh, the, um, it all comes back to that line, right?
The, uh, I hope my death makes more sense than my life.
Yeah.
But all right.
Did murder those guys on the train, but the police don't seem to have that much on him.
Arthur could either-
Wait, Jay wants me to skip back a bit.
Jay, what do you want?
He's the only said his no, that's not skipping back.
Why don't you skip back a bit?
Jay, I have an hour left on the show.
I'm, we're, what, oh, how many minutes do we have left of the video?
You're probably, you're probably close to the end of the review thing.
Cause he said that the end is going to involve a big personal message.
So as soon as he gets to that, we'll probably stop.
Cause you know, it's not analysis anymore.
It's more like whatever's going on with him and his channel, which is fine.
Why is it Chinese spam?
What the hell?
Yeah.
I don't know what in the world is going on.
I don't know what in the world is going on.
Okay.
Give me one sec.
Maybe you have friends in China.
Nah, we definitely don't know.
He said Travis pickle.
Really?
Jay, do you know how far back we have to go for that?
Also, um, kind of, do you want to be a mod so that you can,
you can hit the Chinese people while I'm doing everything else?
Um, sure.
Just say someone in chat.
So I'll just fucking mod you then.
Oh, so much spam.
I don't know what to say.
Freaking gone.
Jay, find the timestamp.
You can do it yourself.
I'm sure of it.
Did you say something?
Okay, there we go.
I did the thing.
There you are.
Oh, all right.
Wow.
You just command me to make you a mod.
That is fucked up, dude.
There you go.
Now you can kill Chinese people.
Like you can be a lot of power, dude.
I mean, if they show up again, you'll be fine.
Chat, it's all right.
You're all right.
It's fine.
It's all right, chat.
I got you.
Apparently, him saying Travis Pickle is way too far back.
I like that he would have fucked up both protagonists
for both those movies, though.
Sounds funny.
All right.
Let's go on over.
And yeah, Arthur did murder those guys on the train,
but the police don't seem to have that much on him.
Arthur could either just ignore the police
and hope he doesn't get convicted,
or he could explain a situation, claim self-defense,
which it's kind of true, except for that third guy.
But hey, maybe just say that you were fighting with him
or something.
Listen, I'm not suggesting that Arthur should lie
or anything like that to the police,
but he does have options.
This doesn't need to be the end of his life.
We need a character.
Okay, so he's saying, oh, Arthur,
you shouldn't feel like it's all over
just because you can cover up these murders.
I think it goes deeper than that, dude.
It's not just about the fact that you've killed people.
Actually, can't you just block flute musician?
Oh, well, you can just ban him, right?
Oh, I don't know.
It looks like Jenna and Despo deleted his shit.
Oh, if they're here, they'll kill him too.
No worries.
I'm sorry, China.
You're not welcome here.
Yeah, there's more to...
I don't know.
I'm trying to argue that he's like,
hey, Joker shouldn't feel like killing himself
at that point in the movie.
I just feel like, oh, okay.
I love the idea, by the way.
Let's just say Nando is a friend of his in the movie.
He's like, dude, it's not all over.
You can just say that those murders were an accident.
Like, what the fuck?
Like, I'm dealing with more than that, dude.
Come on, bro.
Come on, bro.
Go to this gun control rally with me.
You can really learn something.
Guns are my end.
The trigger, pull the finger.
Oh, my God.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
You're saying that there's a movie of where
Luke Skywalker runs around killing children.
Oh, it's wonderful.
We need a character to give Arthur that perspective.
Present him with a choice.
Use his appearance to get revenge on someone who wronged
him in the past, or ignore that and use the appearance
to get a better future.
Arthur chooses the past.
And that sends him down a self-destructive path
that ends with him murdering a talk show host
and maybe inciting a riot.
Although it's unclear how much he's doing.
Oh, my God.
Now he's doing a bad path.
He's changed way too much for this to work the same way.
How are you supposed to improve his fucking image
killed people on the wrong path when he decides to go.
I like the whole.
I just tell the right jokes.
I can salvage my image, man.
I like how much he's desperate to try and create
this choice at the end of the movie.
Wait, and you saw what he was like.
Oh, there's multiple accounts for hiding on the channel.
We're not idiot.
Yeah.
Oh, gosh.
Look, the flute musicians coming in.
Don't worry, chat.
The mods are doing everything they can.
I'm sure of it.
Oh, I imagine some extra people are probably
getting booped by accident as well.
I'm sorry, Hong Kong.
But yeah, I was just going to say
that he's like desperately could drive a choice
at the end of the film.
When I'm assuming the point of the film
was that he was on like a one-way track
thanks to all of these outside elements.
Like it would have turned even the most normal people
and saying, but he also had to have a fucking mental illness
on top of everything else.
Um, go on, go on.
Joker's like, should I?
Oh, my God.
I'm just picturing Joker singing to himself.
Should I choose the smoothest course?
Steady as the being drawn.
Should I blow this motherfucker's head off?
Hey, man.
It's a 50-50 choice, okay?
Oh, you're coming to flute position again.
Oh, my gosh.
Is flute position aware that we can't read any of that?
I was just like, uh.
I don't think they care.
They're just like, spam must happen now.
I mean, it'd be funny if you converted
and it's like, I'm currently streaming
at stream.com slash DWXZZ.
Come watch.
And it's like an actual guy playing like Fortnite.
Okay, guys.
Well, if he's playing Fortnite,
then he's pretty much a dead man.
I'm out of the loop.
Did Fortnite come back after they had that blackout?
I assume so.
I don't know, though.
I don't think any of us play it.
We play great games like Call of Duty.
Isn't that right, Wolf?
Hate Call of Duty.
Well, guys, get comfy with flute musician, okay?
Looks like he wants to keep on coming at this chat.
I mean, I don't want to turn chat off,
but he's obviously using different IPs
and accounts every time, so.
Just cozy on up with the Chinaman.
Part of that, Arthur, actually played.
Seems like the riots were going to happen
with or without him.
But there was an alternative.
An alternative that Sophie was perfectly positioned
to present.
An alternative that would call Joker out.
That would take a stand against his self-pity.
And the self-pity of Taxi Driver and King of Comedy,
and now Joker, used to justify their actions.
Unfortunately, every single character in Joker
was either mean to Arthur or lying to him.
There was no one to present this alternative.
Everyone was mean or lying to him.
Anyone want to challenge that statement?
Does he not remember the midget?
Does anyone ever remember the midget?
Everyone forgets the midget.
Everyone's barely on the midget.
I remember Gary.
Poor guy.
Uh, yeah.
See, like, his thing is, he wants it to be a girl.
It has to be a girl.
It has to be a romantic, generic romantic story.
Otherwise, he just can't, his little mind
can't compute the story.
Apparently, the spam is an opinion on the film in Chinese.
Um, I'm guessing this is the translation.
I interpret the ending of the clown as the end of its beginning.
No one cares or understands.
The clown is now happy at the page and finds it interesting.
What?
I'll paste that to you guys, because apparently that's what it is.
So flute retard is just too dumb to not spam his opinion.
Maybe it's a bad translation.
I don't know.
I hope that's not a bad translation.
Oh, this is another translation.
I explained the end of the clown for the end of its beginning from scratch.
No one cares or understands.
I'm happy about the pain now, and I find it interesting.
What?
How did it just.
I don't know what to make of that.
Good luck.
I'm happy about the pain now.
God bless you, flute musician.
Anyway, instead of using Sophie to present the opposing viewpoint
and introduce gray area into an otherwise black and white story,
Joker wastes Sophie on a surface level Fight Club style twist
that was honestly pretty transparent from the beginning.
What?
Wait, what?
Did he say he killed her?
Is that what he said?
No, he's saying the joke.
No, no, he said the film wasted her.
He's talking about the actual film now, and that she was wasted as a Fight Club-like reveal
that was pretty obvious from the beginning.
Well, there you go.
Anyone see that coming?
What?
So my position, and I said this to my friend that I watched it with,
I was like, I was willing to begin complaining about their relationship.
I was like, there's no way that I'm supposed to believe they're in this much of a committed
relationship when I've had barely any scenes of them connecting.
So I was like, so either she's not real, or this is badly written.
And then when they reveal it, I was like, oh, okay.
All right.
I was assuming bad writing just because of the DCEU track record at that point.
I knew it immediately, because no woman's going to fucking come to your door,
to your greasy ass door, and be like, oh my God, you're such a kid.
Like, what the fuck?
No, no, no, no.
Especially the way race relations were, like in the 80s and shit.
A black woman's just not going to go to some greasy white dude's door and be like,
I don't want to fuck the shit out of you.
No, it's not going to happen.
Not back then, at least.
I like how, so the whole reason I ever would have guessed to that is just because
we just don't think it's realistic what they were portraying.
That's why we guessed it, as opposed to it being like, I knew there was a twist coming.
Yeah, it's not some smarmy shit for me.
It's like, oh, it was so it was so predictable now.
It's like, you know, it's in his head, you know, but it didn't it didn't take me out of the movie.
At all.
No, no, I think I don't think it damages the movie at all that I had an inkling of that was the case.
I'm fine with that.
It seems like a lot of people who don't like the film will often reference
the flashback bit and the reveal and like the heavy focus on that.
For me, I'm just like, I guess the film's doing pretty well then.
If that's like your big issue.
Like, we got anything else?
It's like, it doesn't mean anything like.
All right.
I mean, this guy's argument is that the film didn't challenge Joker enough.
And yeah, that was a little bit scary, but all right.
Twist that was honestly pretty transparent from the beginning.
Oh, and one more thing.
If you've been watching videos on this channel for a while,
you're probably familiar with this video sponsor.
Curiosity.
No, blink, blink, please.
Fucking blink.
I think that's it.
Right.
Because because because he said he's going to talk about some personal now.
Right.
This is curiosity.
It's a deal.
It's just two ninety nine a month or 1999 for a year.
Okay.
And if you can believe me, that deals about cyanide.
And when you subscribe to the stream dot com slash Nando.
And you also have a subscription to something called Nebula.
Oh, no, there's another thing.
Nebula is a new subscription streaming service created by
independent creators, some of which you definitely already know,
like Wendover Productions or I don't know who's Wendover is,
but I don't see GP Grey.
See GP Grey or Kutska's art or Patrick Willems.
No, full circle.
We got it.
Inception.
Dabbit Willems.
Or me.
Here's how it works.
First, all of my new videos are uploaded to Nebula.
Wait, sorry.
Hang on.
I need to.
What was this subtitle?
Me.
One small change can make a big difference.
This was not a small change, good man.
Change the whole fucking movie.
Here's how it works.
First, all of my new videos are uploaded to Nebula ad free.
But second, we're able to work on other stuff.
Like, for instance, there's a collaborative project that's ongoing called working titles,
where a bunch of us creators have gotten together and we've each picked the television show with
a title sequence that we find interesting.
And then, in the videos, we talk about why that title sequence is cool.
For instance, Polyphonic did an episode.
This sounds so lame.
What the hell is this?
You guys teamed up.
I like everyone saying ad block now.
They teamed up to talk about why title sequences are specific ones.
Okay.
But on Game of Thrones, Patrick Willems did an episode on the 90s X-Men animated series.
Just right did an episode on the Batman.
Oh, no.
Just just rights that it's the it's the fucking video essay team.
They like it.
They like retarded Avengers animated series.
And I'll also be producing a video for this series where I talk about one of my favorite
television shows of the last 10 years that also happens to have one of the most exciting
title sequences in the history of television.
Here's a clue about which show I'm talking about.
I know what it is.
I don't know why I started that one.
Basically, Nebula is a sandbox where creators are free to experiment.
We can make cool new videos and series that don't have to cater to YouTube.
Like three minutes left, you know, where's the five seconds then skip?
Well, what happened?
I miss that stuff like that.
And right now, if you go to curiosity stream dot com slash Nando, don't do it.
Sign up for curious guys run.
I don't want to say this guy is not.
I don't want to hear this guy run off like fucking sponsorship.
But not because I don't like sponsorship is because it's him.
Like I don't want to fucking look at you while hearing this shit.
You're not you're not tempting me.
No stream.
You will also get access to Nebula for as long as you're subscribed to curiosity stream.
And on top of that, if you go to that link and you sign up, you get 30 days for free.
It is a win win win win.
What am I going to have to pay?
Is that a win?
Bayouin said that this Nebula thing with all these creators is like pay.
Yeah, that would be paid.
Pay for several.
So Nebula is one of the things that's really important to me.
Here's the other one.
If you're watching this video before November 2nd, 2019, on November 2nd, 2019,
I will be participating in an extra life charity stream.
If you're not familiar with extra, it's a.
Can I hear you?
I think this is the thing that he said.
So all right.
That's it.
We did it.
Two Joker takes.
That's another two down.
We've got like 17.
It's fine.
Sexual harassment.
So yeah, what did you what do you guys think?
Which one was the worst video?
It's always always always okay.
Well, I don't know, because I've been playing a video game for this entire second video to
like numb the pain.
So I might this one might be as bad and I'm just not cognizant of it.
But movie Bob hurt more.
Yes, I agree.
Movie Bob hurt more.
Um, I think this guy got more like fucked up about Joker though.
I don't know what to say.
They're one of them or even like criticisms because they don't even provide anything.
This guy was just like, let me show you how I can fuck up this.
Let me take something that's great.
And then movie Bob was like, let me tell you why Joker sucks and then not provide
anything to back up any of his points.
Um, from what I started dying laughing at this guy's
fucking hilarious.
That was a blast.
Like with movie Bob, it's just like you just sit back and listen and call him a fat bastard.
And then you can't do a kick.
Oh man.
Like, I don't know.
It's just, uh, there's a lot of, you know, we can check out more as time goes on in terms
of Joker is bad takes, but he's all very good.
But a lot of people really didn't like Joker.
It was quite surprising.
And I don't know if it's partly to do with the fact that it's really successful.
So it's like, I gotta say something about this because I'm a,
I'm a film connoisseur.
I know what film is about.
Like, I think that if the film flopped and nobody actually talked about it, movie Bob
wouldn't have made a second video.
You might not even made a first one.
I wonder what would have changed.
Like what we can change in movie Bob's life.
If we were to go into the past, like find baby movie Bob.
Like what do we change to prevent him from, like, what do we change?
There's a ball of dough.
We're like, we broke it.
Oh, shit.
He's got those same shades on.
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, I've got so much time has already got.
I'm assuming if you've got like 20 minutes at most is kind of what I made before.
I'm just collecting some memes and then I will allow you guys to leave.
Yeah, I got to open in the morning, so don't have much time, unfortunately.
Oh, yeah, I got 20 minutes.
Sweet.
I love how the frags doesn't come back.
It's just I'm just going to read super chats alone.
Like, yay.
But it's okay.
Also.
Oh, my goodness.
Some of these memes.
Oh, you'll you'll have froggled by that point.
I guess I could drag him.
I'd also drag Jay on if he wants to be dragged.
You know, my stream should only be about two and a half hours.
So if you're still reading the chats, which I'm assuming you are, I'll come back.
Well, the last time we only capped out the timer at 12 hours.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Like, it'll be fine.
The fact is, I'm still collecting memes.
How long have we been going for?
Five and a half hours.
I knew this was going to happen.
Have you guys noticed that some of these streams go kind of long?
No, no.
Did you notice that long men are bad?
Yes.
Everyone knows that you get told that in primary school.
Oh, I guess you guys call it.
No, wait.
What do you guys call primary school?
Grade school.
Elementary school.
Oh, that.
Yeah.
Well, I think isn't primary school like across like every single year of school or.
I don't know how it works, and you're terrible, like communist country.
Yeah.
What?
Yeah.
What what to you is primary school?
So he is.
Well, this is the thing that this isn't going to make sense
because you guys have grades not years.
Well, it's the same thing, essentially.
I don't think it is.
Explain.
Well, that wouldn't even help anyway.
If I said it goes from year one to year six, you guys would be like,
I don't know if that's grade one to grade six.
I don't know if that's how that works.
Okay.
Well, how long is a year for you in school?
Like the ones complete year?
Yes.
Okay.
So that your very first year of school, you know, you go when you're like five or six.
That to us is kindergarten.
And we got first grade, second grade, third grade, so on and so forth.
Kindergarten is age four over here.
I think four and five.
That's enough.
I think.
I mean, I started kindergarten when I was four, but I think that they might have raised it or
they have some kind of weird cutoff based on your birthday.
But yeah, you go to kindergarten then.
So for that, is that year one for you?
Kindergarten and then you go to year one.
Oh, sorry.
I guess you could, it goes kindergarten reception year one, two, three, four, five,
six, but I don't know if that's entirely standardized across Britain or if that was
the school I was going to.
Okay.
So how old are you when you were in reception?
That would have been, I guess, from what I remember that might have been age four,
actually.
And the year before that is three and the year after that would be five.
So you preschool.
So you went to preschool, then you went to, I guess the second year of preschool,
then you went to kindergarten.
That was year one for you.
Wait, just dude.
What's yours?
He goes, you guys go before high school is what middle middle school.
There's there's elementary school, middle school and high school and then college.
Oh, yeah.
So what do you call your years in high school?
How many years are you in high school?
So if yours goes elementary, then middle, then high hours goes.
Uh, primary and then there is no middle school and the rest is comprehensive school.
High school for you guys is comprehensive school for us.
How old are you when you go to comprehensive school?
I can't actually remember exactly the age.
Honestly, I haven't thought about it.
So the problem as well is I consume so much American media that I fucking
forgotten a lot about, um, like what, what years and what things happened.
I'm picturing four year old baller walking into class with this gas mask on.
Okay.
How many years is comprehension school?
Is it just that goes from year seven to year 11 and then two years of sixth form,
I believe, or the sixth form is like, you get, you can, you don't have to continue,
but it's like, it's like super high school years.
It's like super high school years.
And then you go over to university slash college.
Is it better to go to sick form or just go to university?
Most people try to sixth form is like bonus education, I guess,
but you don't have to.
I think that's the end of mandatory education.
I'm really not the person to be asking this, by the way, I probably got this.
Well, you keep asking questions.
I'm willing to drop it.
I'm trying to understand this.
Yeah.
I'm not the person that's going to be able to help you with that.
Okay.
I don't remember this.
Why does your stupid country do everything so overly complicated?
You guys took our stuff and changed it.
We did it first.
But we made it better.
We took something and improved upon it.
Yours sounds more complicated.
There's more things.
No, it's very, very simple.
Well, it's just, it's just preschool, kindergarten, first grade, second grade,
third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade, sixth grade, seventh and eighth grade,
and then high school, four years of high school.
And I said, no, no, middle school is six.
Here we go.
Well, well, well, it depends on what middle school you go to.
Because I've seen a couple that like, uh, it'll go from like grades.
Well, some elementary schools go up to grade six and then it's just seven and eight for
middle school.
That's not the one I went to.
No, I went to one where it was six, seventh and eighth, and then you go to high school.
That was mine.
That was mine.
Yeah.
Yeah, that was, that was mine too.
I thought that's what I said.
I don't know.
I'm daft from those fucking videos.
No, you know, brains have melted to a degree here, guys.
You got to remember the nonsense for how many hours now?
Too many, four, five, probably five.
There was a lot of discussion in between.
So maybe four.
Yeah.
I'm collecting memes.
I'm doing it.
Gosh, people with their meme.
Oh, my God.
I guess someone tweeted me.
You cannot be serious.
These are so cheap.
They have IKEA lamps.
They use IKEA lamps in the Batcave on Batwoman.
Oh, what?
Wait a minute.
Wait, I'll show you.
I'll show you.
Hold on.
Let me, let me screen cap this shit.
This is so funny.
Best soundtrack ever.
Oh, fabulous.
I miss our our Chinese guest who is sharing his opinions about movies.
I wait for the screen cap.
Oh, what the hell is this?
God, this fucking shit tons of bulb memes.
I can't imagine why.
Did we cover this this song?
Um, I was watching two videos.
Yeah, I know.
We're pretty fast today, aren't we?
You might even say disappointing.
But I mean, this is how it goes.
Okay, let me have a look at this.
That's amazing.
Oh, my God.
You're right.
I mean, let's just I don't know.
Bruce Bolt with IKEA.
What could you say?
It's just like, yeah, it's just like he's got a way manner discount.
Do you think it's like when Alice's thugs wore Gucci shoes,
complained about how to fucking broke.
Get the fuck out of here.
Yeah.
Did you see that they eat like six hundred dollar shoes?
They eat out of cans and takeaway, but then they also like live in a kitchen.
And then you see them cooking from it in one of the episodes.
And it's like, what what are you guys doing?
We are while they're while they're wearing six hundred dollar Gucci shoes.
They're a confusing team.
Priorities, everyone.
Um, the no sense.
Having memes drip in from Discord, Twitter,
PM's and everywhere, trying to collect them all.
The daunting task, to say the least.
Feel bad that rags might miss the memes, but what can you do?
You know, what can you do?
Not our fault. He quit.
Joaquin, can you do?
That makes sense.
All right.
Discord has to stay off screen for a moment.
There's a play inside your head.
We're getting a lot more episodes of that, you know.
Oh, God, like you think it'd be over after the next episode,
like the next episode feels like a finale, like finale episode.
Yeah. Um, but I'm guessing they'll do some kind of bait.
Like Alice is dead or defeated or captured.
And then I don't think they're going to kill her.
I feel like that's unlikely, but they'll have some kind of like.
Batman comes back right at the end.
So you see like the back of him or the Joker is the new Joker is around.
And you know, someone's going to be baited.
The guy did say he was riddled the answer at one point, right?
So the Riddler might show up.
Oh, God.
Not saying it's a good thing.
Just saying it's a thing.
It's going to.
I think the next.
Um, what?
Fourteen episodes are going to be the like worst in the first eight.
I can I'm calling it now.
Like, because because you ran out of story like it's over.
Like it looks like this this episode coming up is like it's over.
It's done.
New season.
Oh, you underestimate these writers.
Or you simply estimate them correctly.
It's it's tough to know right now.
Oh, I mean, look, it teases everything.
Like Alice possibly dying.
Alice finally getting her revenge.
She's like she's all glammed up at one of fucking the wife's fucking.
Whatever she's slammed up there.
And she's she's finally going to get this finally going to be some kind of conclusion.
But it seems like it seems like an end of end of season episode.
It does not feel like a mid-season episode.
Yeah, no, it'll be it'll be interesting to see what the hell they're going to try and pull off.
Like this is the end.
Oh, okay.
Memes collected.
How exciting.
All right.
Can't wait.
This is a combination of a new and old meme.
Antiberate the ending of the clown as the end of its beginning.
Conflucious.
It's freaking foolish.
What is wrong with this forehead?
There's going to be some that I'll probably repeatedly show
just that we point out already.
But check that one out as well.
You got so many fucking drawings.
Oh, you might have to click that one.
But so many renditions of Bob.
He's even got a fucking desk controller belt.
Oh, guys, not opening.
No.
Let me see if I can open it on my phone.
And am I not loading it?
Yeah, well, let me load it.
Damn.
Well, if you guys put on the stream, you can see it.
Oh, it's going to slow down.
I suppose.
Oh, just pull it up.
Look at it and then put it back down.
There we go.
It's not loading.
Oh, look at the stream.
It's up there.
All right.
Well, hold on.
Let me get get there.
Bullshit.
Had to be tismy discord.
Come on.
Okay.
Diabetes.
We trust.
Wait, would you read that in the chat?
Oh, yes.
It's floating sugar.
I mean, I just I like the drawing a lot.
It's very good.
Just another like I said, we got a lot of Bob memes.
Hopefully, most of these will just show up.
I feel like someone just put his head on some kind of
hideous creature.
Just like, yep, that's a meme.
I don't even.
That's from the Star Wars animated series, I think.
Why can't you just be normal?
Has no things.
That is the Babadook.
I know these references, at least some of them.
All right.
This one's a little terrifying, but still loving.
Bob in the room.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Is that like a really early picture of Bob or is that somebody else?
I'm assuming that I've seen like several memes with that face.
So I I don't know if that's just a popular fat fatman face to use or what.
Yeah.
Admiral Holdo, like he tries to fuck the doll and she keeps giving him vague
instructions on how to fuck her.
The wrong instructions.
He's got the candy floating around him.
Yeah, as people try to say, it is young Bob.
Oh, young Bob was really ugly.
Fucking Spam dude got a meme made out of it.
The ending of the call has ended my great suffering.
It is.
Oh, man.
Congratulations, Chinaman.
You became meme status by accident.
The way of the cloud is just as I thought.
No one understood the fusitians 12 to 13.
He speaks.
People really jumped on that.
That wasn't too long ago that we figured out.
That was what it was, wasn't it?
Like only like 30 minutes.
Maybe the joke.
Oh, it's perfect.
They've taken his bets.
He will have them.
He'll find them.
But he will have the last laugh.
I don't know.
I'd watch it.
Just saying.
I would too.
I think we all know this meme very well.
I see a podcast.
I see you on Efap and a lot of bad Joker takes.
Jesus, that's a lot of bad Joker.
Like Jenna just said,
Wolf has me googling popular fat man face.
Oh, hey, we got a plot summary for this one.
Joking Joaquin is a real Joker.
One day he jokes to the wrong person.
Darth Uchi pushed away from his ability to joke by Uchi.
He will learn to reclaim his power and make jokes with his goal
to make the most offensive joke possible.
He joke, which will destroy all minorities
before Uchi can and show him up.
Oh, before she can and show him up.
He'll destroy all minorities.
All right.
So many fucking Diabito memes.
They're like pretty good for the amount of time.
Diabito is an Efap villain, I guess.
Oh, gosh.
And see, then we have other examples of Diabito.
But I mean, you still work.
I don't know why that that one he kind of looks like Jeffrey Donner.
If he put out a few hundred pounds.
Yeah, but I mean, the glasses, the stash, the dark diet.
Is that is that Batwoman's head?
Apparently, I'm just keeping watch of them while having my cup of tea.
You're a snake.
So speaking of Diabito visions, holy shit.
Oh, oh, that's a good one.
You got some long arms and some pretty big wiggle wigs.
A theory on metatextual water farting.
Oh, no.
That bulge is magnificent.
He's quite the creature.
I wonder if he knows that a load of fat art was drawn of him today.
He'd be like, why do I why am I wearing Magneto's clothes?
What's all the chocolate?
What's happening?
Bob V.
Jenny, Dawn of Joker-tisms.
There is so much pointless shit in Joker.
What's that other one say?
There's nothing in Joker.
Well, one of the things she said was it was too overt, right?
You could probably have them clash on that.
But yes, they would clash.
Special.
So this is an image combined with the tweet we read out.
Blended it with his neck.
It looks so natural.
I could believe that was actually in the film.
A hunchbob of diabetes.
The Efap fusions.
It's your standard sort of video game.
Chats involved.
Ra would be the the god in this, I suppose.
Standing on a roof, naturally.
Mm hmm.
This one, you linked.
I didn't get it on screen.
It's like, what's happening exactly?
I can't tell if that's a little Bob coming out of his face.
I'm a little confused, to be perfectly honest.
What the fuck?
I don't know exactly what's happening.
It's also terrifying, yes.
Um, maybe it's supposed to be how he got his dimple.
I, I'm very frightened and frankly confused.
But okay.
I'll go with it.
So like, when people first meet him, he's quite terrifying.
I think that's fair.
Um, nobody's really prepared for the movie, Bob.
I guess this one's just a very quick observation.
I think it's nice and fair.
And it'll remind you of simpler times.
When we were talking just several hours ago.
I any.
Take it easy with those twizzles.
Oh my god, the Mario hat one.
I guess he wanted to like cosplay Mario.
Because there's a lot of those photos.
All right.
Bob, why do you like this?
I don't think we want him to stop.
Roll of the movie.
Look at the droid.
That's a joy to get back there.
Oh man.
As hail, but as sold by Morgan Freeman.
New to the adventure.
I'm not, you know what?
There's a lot to interpret with this image.
I'm not sure what we're supposed to move up.
Movie Bob wishes he was that thin.
He's downright athletic at that point.
Looking good, Bob.
She likes being scrappy to.
Look at that.
I'm little, so I like that.
I guess this isn't really a meme.
I got thrown in.
This was on, I don't think it was,
I think I just caught it from Discord.
If you like a movie, it's wait, sorry.
Go look at more on YouTube.
TLJ is the worst thing ever happened to the franchise.
I like the movie, but god damn, it's objectively the
worst written stalls movie ever.
They've quoted and said, if you like a movie, it's good.
That's how it works.
Okay.
Mola, the guy who spent 12 hours on a livestream mocking
Jenny Nicholson after she made a Joker film review.
Tell me why I should take someone like that seriously.
You don't have to.
I don't care if you take me seriously.
Watch out.
Mola's the kind of guy to name search himself
so he can quote tweet tweets that make him the maddest.
Okay.
Who could have guessed that a guy
who makes a five hour review of a 2.5 hour movie
would have so much free time on his hands.
I mean, this is my job.
Reviewing stuff at this point, full time.
But I mean, all right.
Yeah.
I mean, it's the same exact take.
So does this guy think he's the first person to say,
oh, they boxed Jenny Nicholson for 12 hours.
I mean, maybe it's more accurate with Movie Bob,
especially with this next one.
I like that it's spinning in a circle.
He's like set up the hoop of sugar.
Once again, magnificent bulge.
Why did you draw him with a fucking ball?
How do you know that's is not just fat?
Or could be a donut hole.
We don't know what it is.
It's something that's.
So this is the character from Doctor Who I was talking about.
It's like a flap of skid, but he's deflated.
This is kind of what he would be.
Diabeto deflate.
I'm sure he's still fine.
I don't know what to make of this one.
It's terrifying in its own way.
Why does he keep making this?
Wait, is it like a specific guy?
Yeah, I know who it is.
So it's bigger.
Oh yeah, you still can't.
When even Batwoman can't crack the case,
there's one man that got them.
I know the beams are like absurdly good sometimes.
Like guys.
Oh, he's on his rascal scooter.
Little basket.
I think he's looking at like evidence.
Not nearly as fat as in real life, though.
Well, you know, it is his movie.
Maybe use some digitally defatting sort of stuff.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Digital defatation.
Like how they have D aging, it's defatation.
Diabeto.
He's got the DS made out of half a donut and a popsicle.
I don't know.
When you say the D, I just think of something completely different.
I realize.
Oh, he's talking about the actual.
I think I'm not sure what this is originally, but.
Damn titties, though.
Yeah, you know, you got four of them.
Double decker titties.
And now for something completely different.
Pikachu made an animated rags.
I will have to save this one for when rags returns.
But oh, it's adorable.
Oh, I guess catastropica.
I don't know if that's the same person as Pikachu, actually.
I might be wrong.
I'm assuming it is, though.
Digital D slimming actually exists, by the way.
According to chat, digital slimming actually exists.
I can believe.
I don't I don't know.
He looks so happy, though.
Detective, I have hawks on the case.
All he needs is his hat.
He's complete.
I think these were the from the ork references.
Oh, no, I guess.
I love the idea of an ork becomes a movie review.
Seriously, so much so much passion in these these Diabeto.
We were a joke for you.
You will be defeated by me, Diabeto.
I think he's floating all the fat people in the background.
Come with me.
You made it work mostly more effort into that song
that he put into his video.
So it's all good.
Oh, I got a Bob and Air 2 judge.
Chip Latigan.
Oh, I can't see it.
Come on.
Discord work.
That's great.
That green screen one has just been put in for the image.
Robert.
Oh, this is Bob.
How to go get how to go get those down those fucking stairs.
He's got the scooter.
I just picture him driving down the stairs.
He just falls and he starts bouncing down the stairs like a basketball.
Oh, I like how it's not even the beer hat.
They've just sellotaped the fucking cans.
The candy spirit right there.
This is what a feminist looks like.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
He's on the case, guys.
Right.
Hey, we'll stop right there.
This scooter is surprisingly fast.
Silence log bad.
You would certainly get me.
Back when Rags discussing which one he'd like to bone.
Oh, yes.
See, he is black with red stuff in it.
Not red with black stuff in it.
All right.
One of those infinite sort of questions that faces man.
Is this presenting him as like the villain?
I'd be alright.
Oh, I know this reference is from Wolverine origins.
I think I think.
Oh, yeah.
It's the blob.
You just call me Bob.
You get upset because you call him Bob.
It's a movie, Bob.
Well, you got normal humans as labels.
He's anything but.
The 3D artist, technically.
Detective Diabido Hamahawk on the case.
Guy wrote a blood movie.
Bob did it.
What is he even writing there?
It's a sled with a stick or something.
I like that he's got the colors for Magneto, though.
It looks like a sleigh, but with like cheese curds for.
Maybe the the best dude died was his like the person who pulled it.
The dealer is cheese.
She's dealer.
The rarest of Jesus.
Marsha, the movie, Bob.
It's another perfect neck blend.
I wonder if that hurts his neck.
I think so.
Go on.
Gooby Jew.
Bob when he's the unknown soul.
I need to see my own.
Oh, yeah, I could see a team up.
Oh, another fantastic quote from movie, Bob.
I assume this has nothing to do with this actual stream
outside of the fact that it's movie, Bob.
But there's no such thing as a bad tactic.
Only bad targets.
Kind of makes use of, you know, thank goodness he has no power.
That doesn't make any sense.
Are you telling me there's no such thing as a bad tactic?
Only bad targets.
Well, what if targeting one person over targeting 50 people is the choice?
That would be a bad target and a bad tactic.
I respond to that with a drawing.
I can hear the picture.
I'm going to have to go, but I will come back when my stream is over,
because I'm assuming you're still going to be reading Super Chat.
I think it's almost a guarantee.
It is.
If I don't see.
He only has one leg in that picture.
It was nice meeting you, Jay Wolf.
It was nice streaming with you.
It was nice talking with you.
Um, do you want to just plug your, uh, your channel?
And I guess you'll, you'll stream as it's about to happen, um, for the people in chat.
So guys, uh, I'm going to be doing my weekly show called the Jack show.
It rotates between channels.
Um, me, John Malin, Cecil and Kelsey.
And this week it's my week and I'm already two minutes late for it.
So, but yeah, so kind of late to my own party right now.
But, uh, my, my channel's called that Star Wars girl.
I talk about Star Wars surprise.
And, uh, superheroes and other like stuff in pop culture.
So yeah, that's what I do.
That's what I talk about.
Uh, yeah.
I don't think I have anything else to say, but, uh, oh, I do art videos too.
So there, there's a surprise thing.
There you go.
You gotta hook them in with something.
She's got crazy good art too.
So buy it.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Well, uh, I will be back.
Uh, I'm all I'm assuming you will be here.
It's a guarantee.
So I will talk to you later and, uh, to you others.
Uh, hi.
Yeah.
Thanks for having on later.
All right.
I just noticed that the diabetes has a big leg.
Yeah.
I was just trying to point out about that picture.
It's funny.
God is like chopped off diabetes.
They still got, they got, they got the cats attached to him as well.
So you could drink.
You know what that reminds me of is like the people on my 600 pound life who have
like legs that are rotting off because they're like way too big for them.
If you've ever wanted to like have really good motivation to not get overweight,
just watch clips of that on YouTube.
It's really good motivator to work out actually.
Yeah.
I feel like these memes have been pretty good motivation.
Finally finished the script for episode nine.
Mr. Mouse can't just recycle an older styles movie again.
Do it over.
He just looks at Harry Potter, the goblet of fire.
I don't even, I don't understand what the reference.
Yeah.
I think I might be missing something.
Maybe, maybe the joke is like, he just can't do anything original past off something.
You'll rip off.
That's what he, what he's been.
I could see it.
JJ has no limits.
This is what feminist looks like.
Yeah.
Such an embarrassing photo.
Is that, that's a movie Bob still.
I think that face does kind of match up because he's got like the dimples on us
pronounced, but they're still there.
Like I could believe this is him 10 years ago, you know?
He might actually be not as fat now because those are, those are some.
Titanic cities.
Yeah.
Um, I also kind of want to point out like it says the following picture
includes major spoilers for hell.
Yeah.
That's really good.
He just.
Oh man.
I can't remember if we looked at this one or not yet, but this, you know,
you have all kinds of different things that.
It sounds more like a command to that point.
So do you like that they photoshopped the belly?
Like they've just expanded it out.
Thank God.
I still hope he's not that color looks tight after yourself.
They're bothered.
Some pixel art for Bob looking good.
Confident.
Oh my God.
So this is the X two seed, I guess too much sugar in your blood.
He's like tearing the skin off.
Again, I mean, you know, these movie ideas, you should pursue them.
This is the, I was hacked alien from ages ago, but I guess with a ball of skin on it,
I just, I like it.
It's cool.
It's what happens when people think this is just me.
That's what the aliens look like.
And so if I'm an alien, this is what I would look like.
I should be like, I'm not an alien.
Guess talking about.
It's good stuff.
Oh, this is a Mandalorian meme.
Go to stupid rock thing for you.
Gio Gio.
They're all eating the G.
Jesus.
Can somebody kick Jay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what rags would want at that point, I think.
Oh, I think this makes a lot of sense.
And episode nine rolls around.
There's only one thing that'll happen.
Fucking everyone will have courage on it.
You know, it would be a better meme if it was that meme, uh, the, uh, the black, um,
the, uh, the black, the ball, the black guys on the white chick, the orgy me.
All right.
Oh, no.
Maybe it could be applicable.
My diabetic rage.
Oh, my.
Well, this is about you, I guess.
I fear no man.
Oh, wait, I can't read all of it, but that thing, it scares me.
Oh, that's a good one.
When I was trying to get OBS to fucking behave, it's like confused screaming.
Confused screaming.
Oh, these are so good.
Logic facts.
Just a good old fashioned meme at that point.
Oh.
Oh, boy.
What's this one?
Hey, so remember when we were watching that just right video and it got all the
tism?
Well, I must have raged out because I woke up and my channel was gone.
Then mauler was like, it's been three months.
Come on.
We're covering Jenny Nicholson.
This is okay.
Absolutely a summary of accuracy to the events.
What have you said?
I don't know.
This one was just sent to me, so I don't know if you got it, but I love it.
Movie blob in his natural environment.
Oh, fuck.
There we go.
Hang on.
There you go.
I feel like he would he would feel powerful in there.
Yes, this is natural environment sort of thing.
Again, so many visions of Diabeto.
This is great.
He's stronger than you think.
Don't yet don't underestimate Diabeto, guys.
All right.
I see you in chat.
They're thinking about it.
This is.
Oh.
The blob.
Wait, that is the blob, right?
Oh, I think so.
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Spiders predicted.
We bought his own spider.
Why didn't the spiders tell us?
I think the spiders wanted this to happen.
They don't usually tell us when it's stuff they want us to experience.
Spiders betrayed us.
I don't know.
Maybe it was for our for our best interest.
We knew that you can't stop me.
Detective Ham Hawk.
My blood sugar levels is beyond your understanding.
He's got his little crab.
Oh, boy.
He's like wearing a diaper, I think.
I think this is the translation of the Chinese lettering.
I explained the end of the clown or the end of its beginning from scratch.
No one cares or understands clown.
I am happy about the pain now, and I found it interesting.
I shall the ending of the clown is explained as the end of its beginning from the beginning.
No one care.
Understanding the clown is now happy with the pain and found that it's interesting.
I explained the ending of the clown is starting.
I think it's repeating.
I'm not sure, but I think you get the gist.
Yeah, nailed it.
Oh, well, here's a here's one that just came in pretty relevant right now.
Oh, give me a sec.
Color orange breeds.
Raggers description.
Lost rags.
Last seen on E561.
If found, please return to mauler.
He'll be back.
I am actually curious at this point what pulled him out for fucking,
what is this, four hours now?
Three hours?
I hope you're okay rags.
I mean, he missed the entire second video.
Did he?
Yeah, yeah.
Maybe he's dead.
Maybe that's just your opinion.
All right, now we got just a couple of older memes and then we'll be moving right along.
This is obviously the new template we're going for with Efap,
because we're a very leftist podcast as according to knobs.
I hope you guys like it.
I like that they didn't even bother to just like magic tool out the magic one tool.
That's so fucking disturbing.
Jeb, Jeb Biggs.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, you're right.
It has been like just about two and a half hours.
God, I ironically hated.
It's not about the themes, about good stories and characters.
Everything is.
Yeah, shitty video essays.
This one's like a whole story.
Now our podcast is small, but there's a lot of potential for aggressive expansion.
So which one of you gentlemen would like to join our little team?
Oh, and there's only one spot for our newly open spot right now.
So, oh, it's between Fringy and Jay, apparently.
Even Chat has got a gun on them.
We're going to have tryouts.
Oh, and his robot head.
Make it long.
Because they say make it quick.
I love it.
Memes ahoy.
Oh, shit, we got a description of the plot for Star Wars episode nine, too.
Age of Otschi.
The universe is in anarchy after C-3PO says the N-word before Finn can grant him a pass.
The shockwave of the power released spawns a new foe named Otschi.
Uh, being so powerful, he can say any slur he wants whenever he wants to whoever he wants.
It will take the team, uh, team up of a black person, Lando, and a Jew, Kylo, and a woman
to stop this new threat before he can become the CEO of racism.
I love that a woman is just really nebulous.
They don't even specify which one.
Just anyone will.
Just what one of them will do.
Is that one of Jeb's new movies?
Old Jeb on the massive front.
Artificial gut of shooting.
Oh, wow.
Jenny's in this one.
So it's Quinton.
One of them big get together movies.
Um, I guess this is me as Lincoln or Tommy Lee Jones.
Abraham Lincoln has asked us to work with him to accomplish the death of slavery.
Thaddeus Stevens.
I, I'm not a hundred percent on that one.
I, yeah, I don't, I don't know.
Man of Polst, right?
Man of Polst.
That, that actually kind of looks almost convincing.
Yeah.
Like I could believe it until I look closer.
I want to see this.
It'll probably be more entertaining than the actual Man of Steel movie.
Oh, oh, hey, look.
One of the deleted screenshots that have come out about the new Star Wars.
That's pretty cool.
Word.
You like this one.
Detroit become Jeb.
It's just his face.
Oh yeah.
I guess C3PO deciphers the dagger and it says Ray is a Mary Sue.
Even got an ER reference in there.
Oh, offensive.
Like how there's like three different versions of the last Jeb.
Well, this is last Jedi.
It looks, it looks flawless.
Like the Jedi is completely, it looks great.
And then Jeb's face looks perfectly Photoshopped in there.
They even got the red on there in the blue with the lightsabers.
I could, I could see this.
I could, I could see this.
I could see his name was Jeb Skywalker all along.
It wasn't Luke.
Mark Hamill was wrong.
It wasn't Jake.
It wasn't Jake.
It was Jeb.
Bring this down a bit.
We got this from the new Rick and Morty episode or the first one.
I don't care about the timeline like creators of Terminator dark fate.
Find themes.
Find Joker theme.
Jenny video retarded obsession.
Jenny Twitter drama.
Jenny twatter followers.
He found his sexist toxic red pill retarded don't watch 12 hours.
Jeb egg.
It grows in her brain.
Beams are born.
Oh my goodness.
Well, it's an interesting interpretation of events, but relatively accurate.
Also terrifying.
Also by Wolf, I guess.
God.
Some fucking incels did an 11 hour video about Kyla watching Ray shitting.
They're raging.
It is true.
This was done.
Oh God, we lost another one.
Um, well, I'm just going to keep going.
In a gentle way, you can shake the world.
Mahatma Gandhi.
Please clap.
Jeb debates are gay.
No bullshit.
Yeah.
Debates are gay.
Yeah.
I actually saw that part of the stream.
Oh, did you?
Yeah, I didn't see the whole one.
I stopped in on that.
Well, no, you know, no, I think it was done and I were wound to that part.
And I had to stop because I had to do something else.
I saw it like you said.
He has like the juicy voice you expect him to have.
Yeah, debates are gay.
Bro, dude, bro.
Debates are gay, dude.
Debates are gay.
That's like, it's a good quote.
It's like a shitty Harry Potter name.
Harry Potter and the quiz.
What?
Can't say it sounds that interesting, but maybe.
Oh, hey, so this is a reference to the new battle episode.
The Italian chef.
You'll have it the big day.
Get the fuck out.
Oh, it's a nice little drawing of Ron, his rooftop.
Looks like he's sailing on it.
The work and Joe looking massive will learn to fear my fucking rooftop.
It makes sense.
In law, he's a person who throws people off roofs.
Don't worry about it.
It's relatively complex to keep track.
So Rags accidentally called angry Joe angry Jew once.
Angry Jew versus the dynamic his static.
To all of Jebsters.
Is in the background.
Apparently, this is like a real ass post.
So they just put jab on it.
Oh, what the hell happened?
Oh, delightfully.
Delightful lazy.
Because that's what he that was his thing, right?
He wrote his slogan or whatever.
Just a jab.
Yeah.
Jab.
Jab is a Nefab fan.
Oh, absolutely.
I see a chick in the background laughing at him.
Yeah, hang on.
Jeb supports us even in his rallies.
Good old Jeb.
Jeb brought wolf back praise.
But yeah, it was the spiders for seeing exactly what was going to happen
with the Jen Jeb nickel stream.
And you know what?
You know what?
They didn't stop it from happening.
It's just how it works.
Oh, yeah, we became big fans of Darth Uchi toward the end.
And so this is get well, Uchi.
We love Uchi.
McMuffins.
What's the what's the story behind the McMuffins?
I don't know.
I don't know the lore.
So in the film, there's a lot of MacGuffins and death bullshit when trying to read out
some stuff, mention one of them.
And then he said another another fucking McMuffin.
It's because he was hungry.
Rags, you drunk.
Oh, yeah, three beers.
Three is enough for rags.
Adorable little doggo gets super drunk, super fast.
Oh, wait, did we show this one already?
I can't remember, but I find it hilarious.
Rags is clearly a right wing racist.
It's like, no, he's obviously a gay leftist.
Retard.
So many movies we have to go see according to these memes.
Look at this McMuffin.
It's just Ray staring at a goddamn McMuffin.
Hey, these are top quality memes, OK?
She went to the McMuffin planet.
The Jebbs.
They have cub.
This spider predicts all.
I think you might have shown that one already.
No, the other one had a movie Bob.
I think it's a template.
Oh, OK.
Oh, I got you.
Movies don't need logic consistency.
Me online.
I can't.
What does that do for Ben 10?
The watch?
Does it?
Oh, you tap the watch and become whatever monster you selected.
So they're turning into you.
I wish I didn't know that.
That's a really bad show that I thought was good when I was a kid.
Oh.
This is just a photo of obviously a school where they teach
probably and they put in jab the bush.
Someone actually did this.
Twitch TV slash.
What is that?
Thord the breeky.
Thordmas.
I don't know, but.
Follow slash tune in.
I can't even read what the link is.
But OK.
This is fucking great.
I love this.
This is taking my friends.
That's priceless.
Oh my God.
Look at my friends.
Don't worry.
Not you.
Literally forgot your names.
But not you.
Not you, niggas, of course.
Oh, wow.
Check this out.
One of them horror movies I hear so much about.
He doesn't look please.
No, he's unhappy.
Yeah, not the greatest living situation for him.
See, and that's you know, you have that direct comparison.
He's much happier here.
Bush.
I thought that was the name of the movie.
I looked down.
Bush Bush.
It looks almost good enough to be convincing.
Like what a very nice.
This is going to confuse the shit out of Jay Longbone.
It'll be great.
The long men were created by Tonal Bloke.
After the final battle between the cosmic chicken and Goliath,
the long men are fascinating creatures.
Their height can go up to 15 feet.
The longest long men grew to be 20 feet tall.
Most long men live to be 50 million years old.
The oldest long men live to 1.2 billion years old.
The long men do not need to eat, sleep or drink.
They live off objectivity, long discussions and critiques.
They have incredible speed.
It is said they can run around the entire world in five seconds.
It is objectively impossible to record their exact speed.
The long men have extreme elasticity.
They can stretch their arms to great lengths,
which would make them very dangerous as an opponent as an opponent.
The first sighting was from an explorer by the name Patrick Williams
of in 4000 BC during his quest to find the mystical plot hole.
Williams wrote in a letter,
I saw this creature that looked like a giant skull on wheels.
He later writes that it was too quick for him to get a better look.
Bigidius added in his teachings that the long man must hide his face
because eye contact and turn a man into atoms.
There is no further information on this creature
because they were said to have been wiped out by
Quintinius the Immortal during the great Tism of 2050 BC.
There was only one survivor.
This document must never be discovered by Quintinius.
I have hidden my identity for my safety.
Oh, I was translated by Scooby Doobius.
This is another one from the 3D drawings.
Just log bad, bad.
I'm like cycling around through portals on this molten island.
I'm assuming this is Twitter.
Like, I don't know how else you would depict Twitter, to be honest with you.
But if you click this, or it should just play it, that's like a video version.
And I like that it just has Epstein.
Epstein didn't kill himself in the background.
Oh, it's beautiful.
And yeah, that does it for the memes.
I know there's going to be more, but they're all the ones that I collected.
And I know there's probably a lot of people out there right now,
like, what about my meme?
It's like, I swear to God, trying to get them all collected up.
I do.
I think there's two more I've got in my little backlog there.
Give me a sec.
I will grab those.
Oop.
All right.
That should do it.
Okay.
Also, I should say, since apparently some people were mad about what I said about Ben 10,
I haven't watched it in.
Watched it since the whatever I stopped watching when they were like teenagers and
looked dumb to me.
So whenever that was, all I remember is that I, well, actually, no,
I barely remember the show other than like Cthulhu is like the main villain or something.
Space Cthulhu.
I just remember the show being silly.
I don't have any objective reasoning behind it.
I just assumed it was bad in retrospect, but whatever.
If it's good, I don't remember.
I haven't watched it in forever.
So there we go.
I didn't realize there were Ben 10 fans.
I love how I'm just like a dark peanut with purple hair.
I mean, at least you're riding rags.
Not bad.
Riding rags.
Yeah.
I like movie Bob there as well.
Looking fine.
Um, and then we've got, uh, so the vision where, um, everything's slightly different.
God, how do you draw this in such short amount of time?
This is awesome.
I don't know.
I don't know how to do any of this.
It's horrible.
Oh my God.
Someone please, someone please make one of him shaking the shit out of her.
You say, why did you fuck me up for like that?
Why did you do this to me?
Just like the idea that he's like, this is a great change.
It's like, everybody would hate it.
She ruined everything.
Um, Space Cthulhu.
This is why I hate Wolf.
I only remember there being a person who had like tentacles on their face or something.
This is again, pulling from what's probably like 10 years ago.
Memory Wolf.
You can't remember specifically what it was the fuck.
I don't remember what even the, well, I know the main character's name.
I don't remember anyone else's name.
There was like an old dude, I think.
See, this is why I hate Wolf.
Doesn't even remember character names.
What a piece of shit.
What do you have to say for yourself, Wolf?
I don't know.
I didn't realize that there was a large following of Ben 10.
I haven't thought of it since I was a kid.
Well, um, I was actually going to say I'm going to move on over into reading Super Chats now.
I don't want to keep anyone longer than they were having to with all of the video coverage
and the memes.
And I know some people are running out of time.
So would anyone like to eject at this very moment?
Yeah, I think I'm going to have to.
I got a lot of stuff to prepare to leave town Saturday.
But you must plug your channel.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, my channel.
Oh yeah, I guess I should do that.
Yeah, yeah.
Jay Longbone.
I make movie reviews and trailer reactions and funny edits and such.
Right now I'm doing, I'm fucking reacting to Batwoman.
I'm just kind of, well, thankfully they're on hiatus.
So I can do other shit now and I can react to other shit.
So, but yeah, right now I'm just, that's the thing.
That's the Batwoman, that bullshit.
I'm doing that.
So expect more of that in December.
But yeah, that's my channel.
Well, there you go.
I was going to say it should be pretty easy to hit subscribe there in terms of just
check out the reactions to Batwoman because I'm assuming you guys in chat have actually
watched the eFap once.
You'll have an easy in there.
So it's fun getting multiple perspectives on such terrible content.
And yes, at least you won't be alone.
Yeah, it's not really my perspective and they're really that much different.
Like it's just a little easier on one episode than you.
That's about it.
And I still, I still think it like when you said about it, like I completely agree.
I'm just like, for me, I wasn't reacting to it.
Like I should, like I should have when I was watching it.
So I was like, fuck it.
I mean, I don't think anyone's going to deny it.
Like what we were discussing is like one of the worst episodes is still the fucking
elevator one where he's like, his whole plan is to capture people in elevators in the hopes
that Batman will attack him on the rooftops and he can kill him with a Batman killing gun.
It's the most like, what the fuck is happening?
So retarded.
But still excellent TV.
And yeah, you can check out our coverage of it.
It's all there.
Seven episodes worth.
And yeah, we'll we still got an eFap movies to record with you in the future.
So expect fun.
Oh, yes.
Most definitely.
Yeah.
Thanks for coming on.
Appreciate it.
I hope you've been entertained by movie Bob and Nando.
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
Immensely.
Thanks for having me on.
You guys are great.
Oh, yeah.
Um, I just hope you had fun instead of dying.
That's all.
Yeah.
Thank God for that second video that actually got brought me back.
I was getting ready to kill something with movie Bob.
Yeah.
Oh, well, I don't know the only one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I like the little little asterisk at the end.
Like, oh, yeah, we'll screw to.
Well, yeah, I am.
I'm going to go.
Bye.
Yeah.
Bye.
Would you say wait?
No.
Okay.
For a second, I thought you were like, no, don't go.
It's okay.
Also, how come I posted the thing and then it said message retracted on the thing.
Who can retract my messages in my chat?
Who has the authority to do such things?
Maybe it counts as spam or something.
I don't know.
But yes, uh, link is in the description as well.
But Wolf, would you like to, um, exit as well?
Yes, I have to work in the morning.
Would you like to?
Oh, you're, you're some reason I'm retarded.
I didn't put your channel in the description, but, um, you can still plug it.
Go right ahead.
I will link it.
I make a channel that things that you shouldn't watch.
I'm working on a review of Jedi fallen order, although I'm playing it through a second time
and then I'll probably play it through a third time before I actually get the review up.
Although this time is going a lot faster than the first time.
So that might not be as long as I thought.
But yeah, I'm doing that.
And then when I was a Skywalker and then I quit Star Wars forever.
And yeah.
Yay.
I could have sworn you said in your TLJ video that you were never going to watch Star Wars
movie again.
Then you watched Solo and you watch an episode nine.
Well, if you're a, you're a dirty liar and hopefully, uh, you'll keep making videos.
Well, I have, I have like, I had like morbid curiosity to see how badly they would destroy
everything.
But now it's like,
you have an episode 10 made by Ryan Johnson when you have morbid curiosity for that.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm never giving Ryan Johnson a penny of my money ever.
Not even if you do the thing where you buy a different movie and then go to see it.
No, I don't want to give him my time either.
Oh, fair enough.
Oh, well.
And Johnson lost all goodwill that I didn't have in the first place.
But, you know, I, I mean, I, well, I had neutral will because I didn't know anything
about him when I went into the last Jedi.
The only thing I knew about him is that my friend liked Looper.
And I was like, well, that's, that's a thing might be good.
And then, then the last Jedi happened and now I hate Ryan Johnson.
So no, no, never, never doing the thing.
Well, I mean, at least we have to look forward to.
Wait.
So what's, what's the next thing that's going to get done then?
Because you only got a lesson a month.
I'm really going to try.
Yeah.
And I gotta, I'm going to be on vacation the week before Christmas.
So I won't be here for the Rise of Skywalker stream.
And I hope to get the Jedi Fallen Order review out before I go on vacation
because I won't be able to edit it while I'm out.
But yeah.
So hopefully in mid December at the absolute latest, but then again,
you never know with me.
So yeah, I shall leave.
Goodbye, sir.
Have a good everything.
Yeah, that, that probably won't happen.
But yeah, have a good some things.
Sure.
Mm hmm.
And that leaves me and Rags.
Rags, how you doing?
I thought they're like, you've, you've, you've been a little bit quiet this, this stream.
I know you don't like movie ball, but that doesn't mean.
Okay.
Oh, fine.
Rags, you know, it's just, it's clearly just having a bad night tonight.
So we're going to have to try and see if we can find some other avenue
in which for me to grab a soul in compornium, also known as company.
I mean, he sent me a message.
Okay.
So I'm assuming it's okay.
We got a lot to get through.
I feel like I'm probably going to be capping out the 12 hour thing again, but hey.
Really?
We've already made it that far, huh?
Has Rags gone to sleep?
I feel like he has.
I mean, it's been like, what, two hours now?
I don't know.
I hope he's okay.
All right.
He is too.
So this is the one that hit on the street.
This one I had to skip out on.
It said Madlib time.
Efap, give me an ad vib adjective, noun adjective, noun ad vib.
So I remember that I was there.
We got to make it Efap related, right?
That's the idea, I think.
Okay.
So we're going to use Tism once, but Tism applies to all of those.
Yeah.
If we've got, we've got how many nouns?
We'll have massive for one of the nouns, I guess.
So wait, what's first?
It's the nouns first.
Well, we got three nouns.
We'll use, we'll use up them.
This is going to be taken very seriously.
Okay.
This is incredibly serious.
Okay.
Two ad.
So a noun is first, right?
Well, yeah, I was going to say we'll do, yeah, there's two adjectives.
So two adjectives, two nouns and sorry, three nouns, two adverbs, two adjectives.
There we go.
Interesting.
Okay.
Okay.
Right.
So a massive is, wait, maybe I'm, maybe I'm retarded on this as well.
Let me check what adjective is.
A weird naming.
An adjective is a descriptive word.
So massive is, it totally works.
Right.
Yeah.
Cause you wouldn't.
I'm confused what an adverb is though.
Now a noun is a person, place, or thing.
Well, this is the thing.
A noun is like a class of people, place, or thing.
And it's like a massive is a class of person.
What is now?
We can only use it once.
All right.
That'll be the rule.
So okay.
I will use, um, I say massive is fine in the adjective.
All right, fine.
We'll have massive in the adjective.
What about tism?
Maybe noun.
Tism is, um, well, shit.
It could be both.
Couldn't it?
A tism could be a person, right?
It would be tismy if it was an adverb, right?
I, I think so.
Tis adverb is what, what's adverb again.
I'm kind of blanking on that one.
A word or phrase that modifies or qualifies an adjective.
So like, got it.
They are a tismy massive.
Yeah, I think that works.
Okay.
Also, people are irritated with my avatar.
I'm not going to change it.
Sorry.
They liked the other one because it's from fan art.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No excuse.
Um, that's blaming.
What would that be?
That's blaming.
That would probably be an adverb.
Wouldn't that be batsplaining?
Um, maybe, maybe batsplaining would be an adjective.
Well, batsplaining would be massive.
No, no, it's gotta be.
Well, batsplaining has got to be just a regular verb.
Right.
Okay.
We don't have any of them, unfortunately.
Okay.
No verbs.
Okay.
What are the nouns of efap?
Um,
jeb is a person.
Yeah, that word count.
Um, diabeto is definitely going to be there now.
Diabeto.
We've got a diabeto now and he sees strong presence here.
Yep.
And I guess the dawn.
The dawn.
Perfect.
Perfect.
What about locations?
Do we got any locations here?
Well, the way it works is it goes adverb, adverb, adjective, noun, adjective, noun, adverb.
Yeah.
So did we just use all of our persons?
We've lost all our nouns.
We've got one adverb and one adjective left.
We just went persons the whole week.
We went persons whole week.
Oh, you're saying like we could have proper names, like proper location names.
Yeah, because I'm, because I'm sitting here wondering, like,
what kind of like, you know, efap memes do we have that are in terms of nouns, like places?
What locations are in our lore, chat?
That's what I'm wondering.
Yeah, Biggidius would be another person.
I don't think Wales counts as an efap meme.
The opinion hold.
That's true.
Oh, basement apartment.
But I don't know if we're getting too weird.
Basement apartment.
It's a long story.
Okay.
Singapore.
Isle of Man flag is a thing.
Yes, Singapore.
Absolutely.
Let's do Singapore.
Right, Singapore, Diabeto and Jeb.
They'll be our three nouns.
So.
Yeah, I didn't want to go three people, so.
So another adverb.
We've got tisme.
Trying to think of one of the, the Philippines would have been one as well.
The Philippines.
We're probably going to have to rely on chat for this one,
because I'm going to be running blank on everything I asked my head to look for.
Yeah, a lot of them were really loving the Isle of Man flag right now,
in terms of things.
Oh, I know.
I don't know if Isle of Man is three words.
I don't know if it'll scrub his thing or not.
I'm assuming it wouldn't, but I don't know.
I like Singapore.
No, it shouldn't, because if it's a person plays a thing,
it doesn't have to specifically.
Should we swap it to Isle of Man?
I mean, chat seems very keen.
Let's take one of our.
Yeah, let's play.
Take one of our persons and replace it with the Isle of Man flag.
Well, then we'd have you have to lose jab or diabetes.
I'm a fan of both of those.
Let's let's leave diabetes because he's a newcomer,
and he kind of needs to make a splash.
You know what I mean?
Did you see the memes?
Sure, there was lots of you want to pick Singapore over diabetes.
No, we got right now we've got diabetes, Singapore and the Isle of Man flag, right?
Advib, well, I'm just going to stick with jab, diabetes and Isle of Man.
I'm sure it'll work.
You'll be fine.
I swear.
Really?
We're not this Singapore?
Okay.
I mean, it only keeps our podcast to go, and I'm just saying.
I mean, we're not even using it right now.
Okay, we are.
Shut up.
I think we said that before the stream started by bad.
Okay.
They have proof.
Celestially.
Celestial.
Celestially.
Antisomy.
Would it count as an adverb if...
So you're like a tismy massive, a celestial massive.
It would still be an adverb at that point, right?
Celestial.
I think that's adjective at that point.
These rules are complicated, okay?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Celestial is actually defined as an adjective.
All right.
We'll just put it in there.
That works.
Okay.
Which means we got one adverb left.
Vigorously?
I mean, what's that got to do with eFap?
I don't know.
It's the first thing that came to my mind.
Oh, objectively.
Oh, wow.
All right.
Person who sent that super chat.
I think you were Southwood Fawn.
Our choice is for the nouns.
A Jeb, Diabeto, and Isle of Man.
Our two adverbs are tismy and objectively,
and our two adjectives are massive and celestial.
We did it.
And now I'm going to continue.
So first, we got to get all the ones that were missed last time.
That is what I'm now going to begin.
I'm going to be here for a long time.
Much like Jar Jar was in episodes two and three,
much, much less after Phantom Menace.
Rose will show up much less after TLJ,
or she'll be written better.
I think I read that one out, but still.
Yeah, she's going to be in the next episode a hell of a lot less,
but she was never in the first one.
So it's kind of like Jar Jar, kind of not, though.
Rose Tico compared to Jar Jar?
Well, Jar Jar is the much superior character.
I think we can all agree on that.
Yeah, at least people liked Jar Jar at first, you know.
Yeah, nobody ever liked Rose.
That never happened.
No.
Anyone said they did.
They were probably lions.
Fine.
I mean, I'll admit when I was a kid, I liked Jar Jar.
When I was a kid.
I fell asleep during stream, woke up an hour before alarm
exactly at my super chat.
Perfect timing, Mauler.
Also Rags.
I'm from the Netherlands, so negative alt here.
Negative alt here.
Huh.
Is he talking temperature?
I can't remember what that might be referencing.
Rags, what do you think?
That's what sucks about carrying him over, right?
Yeah, Rags, what's your input?
He's been really passive-aggressive today.
He just keeps ignoring me.
Yeah, he's been in the mood.
What's going on, Rags?
Come on, man.
You're being a mean.
Yo, hold on.
What the fuck is, hold on.
What the hell is this?
What?
No, somebody's spamming.
Hang on a minute.
Oh, wow.
That's like multiple accounts too.
Yeah.
What is YouTube's recommended way of getting rid of that outside of,
I guess I would have to get a specific,
I could ban specific words, can't I?
I think, well...
I'm pretty sure I can do that.
We've been hacked.
I don't think that would solve anything.
It would just make chatting a little longer.
Well, it means that they can't actually post anything that connects with,
so for example, if I put streaming live now as a banned word,
I'm pretty sure that'll work.
Give me a moment, chat.
Don't panic.
Let's have a look.
Immunity.
Did I accidentally...
Hang on, I accidentally did somebody else.
Okay.
There you go.
Yeah, holding alt.
There we go.
That's how you really get the job done.
All right.
Now, I've just saved that.
Let's see how long he lasts.
Hopefully it stops, but it might not.
Could be wrong.
Nope, it seems to have stopped right in its goddamn tracks.
Bye-bye.
Right in its tracks.
Look at that shit.
Hey, at least that works.
All right, so...
Hey, it looks like Jenna's still here doing the stuff.
Good shit.
Good job.
Careful chat.
Don't ever say...
I typed it in wrong.
I said, streaming live now.
Dreaming live.
Apparently that worked.
But yeah, don't say streaming live now,
or you might get hit with a block or ban or something.
Just...
I figure there's no reason anyone would need to say streaming live now.
But we shall see.
I can...
So what usually happens with this is I can unban that word then or set later.
Look at the end.
Yeah.
We should be fine.
And thank you, mods, for looking out for, you know, the welfare of the chat.
I know they get very antsy when there's spam.
All right.
Jenna Biok and Chip.
Hi Rags.
He would say hi back, for sure.
It's always great to watch eFap before work,
and it's even better to see it going strong when I get out of work.
Oh well.
Yeah, you got an extra one this week too.
Yeah.
Oh my fucking god, you're still going.
We're reading this one where we've got like a thousand left.
Now you think this is gonna take six hours?
You think so?
I mean, we had less last time that I didn't finish, and it took us five and a half hours.
So that's where we're at.
Though if Rags isn't here, there's a good chance we won't go on as many tangents.
There's a good chance.
Though if something peaks me and you as interests, we still will call on tangents.
I just love the idea that Anna's gone to do her stream.
And by the time, like, you know, she leaves when we started to do super chats,
and she'll be finished, and she'll be back.
Well, we're not even halfway, probably.
But it's fine.
Hashtag Rise of Skywalker endings on Twitter.
Make your own.
Get it trending.
Absolutely love you guys.
Keep up the great content.
I would just type the leaked one and be like, this is my joke ending.
Just be like, wow, it's, uh, that's really stupid.
This would be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you think.
Um, please, if app the ring a binge mode in upcoming last Jedi podcast,
Mallory Ruben says attack of the clones is objectively bad, but ranks TLJ.
Number one.
Star Wars film.
Plus we get to listen to women.
Also Shalom Rags.
Um, Shalom.
Attack of the clones is objective about the TLJ is number one.
Okay.
I was, I was a little, there was like a lot going on in that one.
I was a little confused on what to even respond to.
Well, they want us to check out a podcast where Mallory Ruben says
attack of the clones is objectively bad, but TLJ is number one.
And I mean, if that's all they say, there's not much for us to, you know,
respond to there.
I disagree with that.
All right.
I too.
At least with the part, like the idea of, because I hear a lot of people say like,
you think TLJ is worse than attack of the clones.
There's an argument for those, I suppose, but TLJ is pretty bad.
Um, yeah, but number one.
Oof.
All right.
I'm glad, I'm glad that I can sleep eight hours after the start of the stream.
And if app is still going.
Yep.
And that's see, that's referring to a different one.
Yeah.
There was that, uh, that time when you were with Aiden paladin and oh my God,
that was, that was amazing.
That was, we had the whole,
wasn't the super chat stream, but it was like five hours, something like that.
It was pretty nice.
Yeah.
Hey all, I have a bunch of digital holiday art for you guys.
Where should I send it?
Probably too much for Twitter.
Great stream.
Uh, is it too much for Twitter?
If it is.
I'm trying to think of, I guess, Discord.
My mod should be able to help you out in terms of getting it to the right place.
But I'm curious what it is.
If it's too big for Twitter because Twitter can like support a lot of stuff.
Um, am I too late?
Well, if not, y'all fellas hear that Trump watched Joker.
If Joker is our black panther, then Trump is our Obama.
I heard, yeah, I heard that he, uh, he had people at the office watch it or something.
So he actually, so that wasn't like a meme or anything, huh?
That was real.
Trump sat down and watched Joker.
I think so.
Yeah.
I don't see why not.
I'm sure he watches movies.
Yeah, sure.
Well, say what you will about the guy.
At least he's got taste.
Joker's good shit.
I got two more freebies left.
High rags.
You would say hello.
The super chat freebie here.
If only one rapist is caught, then cinema Roberto's argument is vindicated.
Three and two women are great and desperate times call for desperate measures.
Cinema Roberto was discussed in episode 60.
I don't remember anymore.
I tried to tell you via stupid chat during DP, but Ben didn't read it.
The guy who punched a baby used the defense that he didn't mean to punch the baby.
He meant to KO the lady holding the baby.
God, how did that go for him?
I was trying to tell a jury that it's not as bad as you think.
I wasn't trying to punch the baby.
I was trying to punch the woman holding the baby.
It's like that.
It's like that guy that fucking tried to roundhouse kick that one gal kicked her right in the head.
I'm trying to kick your phone like, um, that's not a hell of a hell of a lot better there, idiot.
Imagine Disney doing this to Buffy, all in service of some new OP slayer,
destroying the point of the series finale.
A reboot would be far preferable.
I just say stay away from Buffy, but if they're going to touch it,
it's going to be terrible.
Probably.
I'm sorry.
Uh, we're all far apart and yet we can talk.
The internet truly is magical.
Imagine what someone from medieval times would Epstein say.
Someone from medieval times would Epstein didn't kill himself.
It is pretty amazing.
I think I already talked about this, but, uh, I did, um,
we just reminisced over like Mario Kart double dash.
And then my friend just downloaded it and, uh, the dolphin emulator and, uh, bam,
we were fucking playing Mario Kart double dash in like 15 minutes and it looked pretty good.
The internet, man.
There's nothing we can't do.
Except some stuff.
Yeah.
Uh, Rags, I've decided to use my two K to buy a gaming PC,
but alas, I am not computer smart.
Where should I go to build the best PC?
Also stance on Koreans.
I don't know what Koreans.
I guess I'll save that question.
Both of those for Rags.
Uh, I can say Koreans are really fucking good at video games.
There you go.
I don't know a heck of a lot of Koreans though,
so I'm afraid that's all I got.
What post workout supplements do you recommend?
I, um, I got no recommendation on that.
Brain Force.
There you go.
It's the legendary supplements from, uh, what are they called?
Info Wars.
That's, uh, packed with soy, I believe for all of your needs.
But yeah, I fucking, I have no idea.
Um, Grace from Dark Fate.
No chest.
Captain Marvel.
No butt.
Ray.
No character.
Daenerys.
No point.
Feel free to add any others who wins the entitled progressive female award.
P.S.
Here's to Dune bringing some sci-fi sanity.
Who wins the entitled progressive female award?
Um, probably Ray or Captain Marvel.
Yeah, I would have to say...
Daenerys, that wasn't exactly a progressive female award.
She admitted like hundreds of thousands of people.
Yeah, and it's like, you know, as much as I didn't like her too much,
she, you know, she had something to struggle for at least, you know,
right up until the end there.
But, um, I would have to go with Captain Marvel.
That MMO Star Wars, the Old Republic,
had all sorts of great stories without force, lightsabers, et cetera.
Agreed.
You don't need them to make great stories,
but they're a cool element, uh, in the world.
And, you know, they've been heavily relied upon in the sequel trilogy
as being like, look, explosions, star destroyers, lightsabers.
You love this stuff.
Palpatine.
Palpatine, cheesy screams, and cream cheese.
What was it?
Cream cheese?
No, no, what were they calling Palpatine?
Creamy sheave.
That's what it was.
Creamy cheese.
Creamy sheave, yeah, yeah.
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The best episode is 48 and 49.
Karl Marx, Homosexuals in the Gallery Museum,
Lesbo Hamill, Apex Lannister, and Fate Gamer Ray.
Also, hi, doggy.
It's a fair choice.
I remember those episodes well.
They were a remarkable Republican, I believe, or him and someone else.
I can't remember.
Um, here's my mandatory viewing fee.
Also, play Mass Effect, you massive Lannister.
Once episode 9 critique is done, share our pain.
Oh, because of how Mass Effect 3 finishes, I believe, is it?
Uh, wait, what was that again?
Sorry, I got distracted.
Also, play Mass Effect, you massive Lannister.
Once episode 9 critique is done, share our pain.
Oh, yeah, because Mass Effect 3 ended really bad.
It's like they tried to fix it, and it only kind of half did it.
Didn't work out because they made a really big promise, and it didn't happen.
And there's a lot of skepticism as to whose fault it is.
By the way, our Mad Lib has just been posted in a chat head-on.
Do you want to look at that real quick?
Oh, yeah.
You're Mad Lib, my friends.
Enjoy.
Art plus plus plus rhino equals equals equals milk.
Mauler and Rags are tismly massive.
Their Isles of Man would be more celestial without J.
Rags thinks Diabetus.
Diabetos.
Diabeto, isn't it?
Rags thinks Diabetos.
Oh, Diabetos, I guess, is a group of people.
Rags thinks Diabetos are better than Jebs, objectively speaking.
I disagree.
Jebs are better.
But, you know, Rags is entitled to his opinion.
Isn't that right, Rags?
He says yes.
Silent treatment.
OK.
All right.
Good stuff.
OK.
Episode nine will be the fall of JJ and Sim reviews.
I think that meant Tism reviews.
But, you know, who knows what's going to fucking happen with reviews?
Video essays.
Holy shit.
It's going to be something.
It's going to be a ride.
Check ER's Twitter.
There's a hot Joker take there.
Oh, yeah, I actually did because I saw that one ahead.
I can't remember what it was, but it was like I think we read it out,
or at least I showed somebody, but there was another one that he had retweeted
where they blocked the O from Joker out like as if it's a swear word.
Like they put an asterisk there.
Like if they were to say the name of the movie, it would bleep.
And it's just like, what the fuck?
I didn't realize it was that offensive, but OK.
I've seen that multiple times, actually, not just there,
but like during like the infancy of the Joker's release movie,
there was a lot of people just bleeping the Joker word.
And I think that has I think that has something to do with YouTube.
Remember when we read that list of things you weren't allowed to say,
and Joker was on there.
So I think that might have been it.
I don't know.
Joker is one of them words.
Holy fuck, you're still going.
I had a whole shift, and we are now still still going.
Party never ends.
So enjoy us in the car on the way back.
I thought I was going to say hi to my unlisted n-words,
but you're still going.
Love you guys.
Also, hi Rags.
Hello as well if you're still there.
If you're still expecting to see unlisted n-words and you're seeing listed n-words.
I hope you're doing well.
Hit about them leaks.
Anakin should have killed us all.
Yeah, well, it wouldn't have mattered.
Because we'd all probably come back anyway.
Yeah, we'd come back and we'd be better than ever.
I'm Efap in bed with some whiskey.
Sargon and Arch Wen.
That could happen.
It almost happened today.
We were looking for guests because the guests I had in mind didn't work out timing wise.
And then funnily enough,
a lot of people get asked and then they can't make it.
And then like a few days later, they're like, actually, I can.
And it's like, oh, fuck.
We already have six people all of a sudden.
Yes, well, that's the thing.
We had nearly a full cast today.
It happens.
It's all good.
We handle.
Everything was handled.
Anyway, I'm of, oh yeah.
Now give me an oo-woo doggo.
I saw that last pic of you.
I'm not sure what that means.
Exactly.
I'm upset you still haven't seen Hardcore Henry.
I'll see it eventually.
I'll do it.
I've been meaning to like, I had got that movie and I put it on my phone and I was ready to watch it on the plane.
And I guess the app that I was using to watch the video just couldn't read the fucking thing.
So I was kind of, I was left to watch the last Jedi on the fucking plane on the what was available.
And that's how I saw the last Jedi on a plane.
Well, you know, there are worse ways to suffer, maybe, I guess at least I didn't pay money to it.
If someone doesn't lose their virginity by twenty five, should we throw them off a roof?
I have to consult the elders and the spiders.
They'll know they'll know what we decide to do and we will decide to do.
What about that from that?
It'll make sense.
Yes, damn, you guys are still going.
It's funny reading these with it from a different stream.
The best drunk movie is Shaun of the Dead.
I think that's a pretty good drunk movie, sure.
It's a great movie.
It's a great movie, generally.
Do you guys think God is the answer to nihilism?
I mean, for some people.
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of people who just they can't seem to live without, you know,
believing there is a deity helping them out and, you know,
giving them something to do with their lives.
Everything and go to find meaning somewhere.
If you feel that nihilism isn't a good enough end point and you want more.
Yeah, pretty much.
So, you know, go for it if it's for you, man.
You massive release Doom video.
Also, I think it's six out of ten.
I think it's probably like that's still not up, is it?
No, and it's still still I think it was three days ago.
I got hit with a copyright claim again.
We're still working on it.
Oh, my God.
Why Doom of all things?
And ironically, now we've been working on this thing for like months
and it's like a 40 minute video where we just laugh at Doom.
Almost every other movies is ready to go, but they have continuity.
So you guys are just going to get a blast of fucking movies suddenly.
And you'll be like, what?
Why does it?
But it's coming.
It's coming.
Anyway, still going.
Why is Despile Shit a fairy?
Not bad.
Not mad, sorry.
You're a fairy apparently.
For the backstory, it's yeah.
Well, for the backstory is actually I used to play Guild Wars two.
I don't really want to play MMOs anymore because like the games
industry has decided that everything has to be an MMO.
Almost everything.
But this is this is a char from Guild Wars two.
I have a warrior.
And so I decided, shit, I'll just get them drawn.
Why not?
Oh, there you go.
That's my char warrior guy.
Good.
He's cool, man.
Are you guys Efap to Chris Stuckman's review of TLJ?
If so, which Efap?
No, we haven't.
And I don't know that like any Efap.
Chris Stuckman video is like really boring to Efap too, I'd say.
What was the last Chris Stuckman video that we watched?
I don't think we've ever covered him on Efap.
I swear, I thought we did.
And I don't know.
I could be wrong.
I think we may have referenced it, but I don't think we've ever actually watched one.
And it would be a while before we'd have to have a pretty tismy take to cover him.
He mostly is like the most inoffensive person ever.
And that's part of why he sucks.
Hey, guys.
May the dawn bless you.
Why thank you.
Dawn bless you all.
Hey, Rags.
Do you know of John CJG, the creator of Arby and the Chief?
I do.
I don't think he does.
He talks about a lot of the same stuff as Efap.
We'd love to see him on here someday.
I mean, if he's interested.
Do you think he's still doing stuff?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he's still making episodes of Arby and the Chief, actually.
Really?
Yeah, because Fringey's been telling me about him.
Wow.
I thought he just straight up ended that.
I grew up with Arby and the Chief.
There was quite a definitive ending in one of the earlier seasons,
but I think you could decide to carry it on.
Yeah, I mean, if ever he showed interest to come on Efap, we'd have him on.
It'd be fun.
Talk to him about Arby and the Chief.
I'd love to talk to him about Arby and the Chief.
All right.
And the final super chat of episode 60.
May the dawn be with you.
So we made it through all the previous ones then, huh?
Yeah, now we're finally to this stream.
You know, that wasn't very long.
It kind of sucked that we had to cut off points.
Yeah, I know, right?
It was just the extra, like, I'd say 20 minutes is all we needed.
I think I said it was about 20 minutes.
Yeah, not too bad.
So someone in chat said,
I love Johnny talked about you guys a few days ago.
Is that true?
Was it in a good light?
Was it in?
Do you know they've been on a 12 hour stream about a woman?
Well, John, CJG, if you like this stuff, we'd be happy to have you.
Yeah, somebody time stamped this, even though you can't right now,
because it's not processed, and send it to him where we say,
we really like your stuff.
Big fans of actually of Arby and the Chief to a certain degree.
I watched the shit out of them before.
I don't really watch them right now,
but I would happily talk about that stuff with you if you're interested.
And have you on, assuming you don't hate us, which is also a possibility.
You got to cover all your bases, you know?
Pretty much, yeah.
Anyway, here we go.
There's a suspicious amount of women on this Efap.
That's a very suitable super chat.
We did have a suspicious amount of women.
Efap on a Thursday, a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
Oh, in the words of Axel from KH2,
I think he's referring to Kingdom Hearts 2.
Oh, I don't know that one.
I've not played that game.
I haven't played any of the Kingdom Hearts series,
but Axel sounds like a Kingdom Hearts character, so there we go.
Why is it that we do when we want to don't?
Well, sometimes your emotions can get in the way of a pragmatic choice,
or vice versa.
You could feel you want to do something,
but pragmatically it's too important, you know?
Keep me up at night, man.
Mola, why are you torturing women to the wrath of cinema Roberto?
Because more people need to fear him.
Okay, that is the answer.
They were, like all of them, Wolf, Jay Longbone,
and Star Wars Girl all had headaches during his video, huh?
Yeah, it's kind of undeniable.
He's very talented at that.
If anything, he needs to look
into that, like, as a power.
That might be, like, Diabito's power.
He gives people headaches.
Too much sugar.
Yeah, he gives them a sugar crash without the high.
Whammon?
Oh, my good Christmas podcast.
Oh, my good Christmas podcast.
Yes.
Oh, I get it.
Oh, my God.
Not movie Bob.
Also, Howdy Anna, Jay Longbone, Mola, Rags.
And last but not least, Wolf.
Love you all.
Very kind, James.
I'm sure they'd all have said hi.
Hey, man.
Estimate date for the meme efap mini?
Yeah, there's nothing that I really need to get on that.
That's my bet.
I'm going to definitely get on that.
Sorry, I've been, because I only, for a second there,
I was just like, I've not been doing it.
What's wrong with me?
I was like, oh, well, in fitness, I really recently finished the whole,
all the Batwoman editing and then all the tisms with sorting out the
the different efaps as well as the copyright stuff.
It's definitely, I'll sort out, I swear to God.
It's the same, I feel bad for the fucking meme stream,
the literal meme stream.
It's still locked away and it could still be locked away
for another 40 days before it's on Mola.
But it will be viewable, hopefully, within 10 days or around 10 days.
So think of that as a December Christmas thing.
It's coming.
The meme stream is coming.
And Wolf is beautiful.
True.
Yeah.
Cats has a budget of 300 million.
Why?
300 million?
Do you really think that we can answer such philosophical questions?
Not possible.
These are the questions that people aren't even meant to answer.
It just hurts to know, man.
What are Whamen doing on an incel podcast?
Well, they're incels too.
And someday they will shoot up a movie theater for playing the wrong movie.
Exactly.
You know, I'm not saying that they're not welcome
unless they're incels on this podcast, but that is what I'm saying.
Like, it kind of disgusts me that someone who's had sex
would be on here who isn't rags.
It's like, what the hell?
I mean, what do you guys think he's been doing this whole time?
He's got to charge his batteries, if you know what I mean.
That's fine by me.
Someone's got to get them charged, you know?
We are the incel leftist podcast.
Yes.
Who is also Nazi right-wingers.
Oh, God.
Like, I haven't been procrastinating enough.
Well, this is seven hours and 17 minutes so far of extra procrastination fuel.
If you, if this is, if movie Bob is your thing.
If that is the case, I apologize.
Just for you.
Hail Massives.
Hey, rags.
Kick J.
He's already been pre-kicked.
This stream comes pre-kicked.
Remember to walk to your jabs, folks.
Also, hi, rags.
Again, he would be saying hi right now.
He's just a little tied up.
And I don't mean that in a BDSM way.
Well, you don't know that.
All he said was that he has to go.
He'll be back, I think.
Okay.
Um, yeah, like I said, I just hope he's all right.
Like, the amount of time he's been missing without a message.
My brain immediately goes to like, oh, I hope something, nothing really bad has happened.
Oh, silence on the internet means death.
I genuinely hope he had a really big fart and then he got tired and fell asleep.
But, uh, yeah.
Free super chat for rags.
Well, I will make a note of you.
Uh, did you ever see Jurassic World battle at Big Rock?
Surprisingly good, in my opinion, for such a short video.
I only had people link me at saying it was terrible.
I forgot to watch it.
Like, um, a couple of fans did and Wolf sent me at saying this is terrible.
So I'm assuming it's not fantastic.
I don't know, though.
You guys are aware of the whole copper situation?
I've heard I watched the Chadtronic video.
I've seen a lot of tics on Twitter.
I think all that's left to do now is wait.
Who knows what they're going to do exactly?
I don't think it's feasible for them to fucking find people across country lines.
I think it's going to get extremely complicated.
But yeah, that's absurd.
There's got to be like, I think they're going to review it like the closer it gets.
And I guess we'll just kind of, it's just kind of a wait and see situation.
It just seems too ridiculous.
It kind of sounds like it also feels like a law that they might put in place that doesn't get acted
upon as in like, they're like, we did it.
We passed it now to implement it.
It's like, I don't fucking, you want to implement this?
I don't know.
I don't know how to do internet.
Like in the, in the idea that they're like, being bad is now illegal.
And there's like a kid who pushes another kid and then they're like, that's illegal.
Like, what are you going to do?
Arrest him?
Okay.
So yeah, we'll have to see what happens.
Very happy to see all of you.
Big thanks, y'all.
Thank you for watching.
Free super chat for that Star Wars girl.
Noted.
Though she's got a stream going right now.
Just go and do it there.
Because it'll be less stuff taken off.
I would imagine with transfers and stuff.
She's currently streaming on her channel with the Jack stream.
I believe it's called.
She's, it's like the Jack podcast.
A suspicious amount of women here.
Oh, and high regs.
You would say hello.
I'm flying to India from Norway soon.
Pretty sure this stream will be going on till I reach my destination.
Hello.
That Jeb girl and Jeb long-boned.
I'm sure they would find that to be complimentive.
Complimentary.
That's the word I was looking for.
So who's rags Jeb's?
I guess it would be, yeah.
I'd be Jeb-less.
You'd be desk Jeb shit.
Yep.
Yep.
Oh, that's bull Jeb.
You could pick Jeb bullshit.
First one's better.
Roses are red.
Mustafar's on fire.
I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new empire.
I was bracing myself for an Epstein, but.
I would say newbie Epstein, yeah.
Those things never usually end properly,
but that one did, and it was almost like it subverted me by ending normally.
Yeah.
So congratulations.
You did better than Ryan Johnson.
Free super chat for Jay Longbone.
Free super chat for Jay Longbone.
All hail Jebimus Prime, leader of the Jebo-
Jebobots.
Also high regs.
Yeah, it makes sense that Jebimus Prime would be the leader of the Jebobots.
I don't see why.
That's not confusing to me.
Um.
Father, grant me slice.
What about dice, though?
You can't have one without the other.
That doesn't make sense.
Elizabeth Banks has said-
I mean, it's like fastened.
Yeah.
Elizabeth Banks has said,
Charlie's Angels failed at the box office because men are too naive to enjoy female
cinema and they are scared of women.
Well.
I don't understand why they go for that take all the goddamn time.
Well, in fitness-
You just hate women.
It's like, you prove it's just not true.
Over and over again.
I watched the trailer for Charlie's Angels and I was terrified.
I was in the corner shaking.
I had a blankie and a teddy bear.
I was fucking shaking, to say the least.
Because breasts are scary.
Just strong, intelligent women making choices.
That, there's nothing scarier than that.
Never lose.
And you know what?
It's weird.
She's right.
Have you noticed that all female-led films just don't make money?
And they're not successful.
Like, fuck that Captain Marvel film?
Complete flop.
Wonder Woman?
Flop.
Force Awakens?
Flop.
The Last Jedi?
Flopped.
Rogue One?
Flopped.
Like, fucking hell.
It's just, it's undeniable.
Men cannot watch women films.
I'm glad we've noticed this.
No.
Anyway.
Hello, my jab words.
Heh heh heh.
Depending on your takes,
Nando may organize another one marvelous scene-esque video essay
collab around taking down Efep.
Also, high-rags.
Oh, dude, that would be wonderful.
Like, every video essayist makes a video on how bad we are.
Can you imagine the fucking free press that would be?
Oh, man.
And then, like, they need to...
I was wondering if they should, like, do a collaboration video.
Make it, like, really goddamn long, just despite the long men?
It begins with, like, Patrick Willems being like,
there's a problem on YouTube.
And it goes to Just Try It.
And it's like, and that problem is Efep.
And it's like, it'd be great.
Slick editing, loads of references to how we ruin everything.
And then it'd be like, this innocent woman,
Jenny Nicholson, was targeted by these people.
That would be, like, the fucking best Efep ever covering that.
We would just bring on, like, fucking 12 people to do it.
Leaks confirmed JJ does cocaine.
I kind of saw that coming.
Free super chat for the rhino spiders.
Oh, they know what's up.
The spiders can see everything coming,
so they know exactly where to go and what ways to get easy money.
So, for example, they walk into an arcade.
Or, like, a gambling machine and stuff.
They'll be like, all right, go to that machine,
press this button and this coin at this time,
and they get all the money.
They'll be fine, no worries.
Free super chat for Wolf.
Very well.
Love to see you guys react to Star Wars fan films
and compare how much better they are than Disney,
especially Shards of the Past from Star Wars Theory.
There could be copyright issues with that.
Also, I don't know.
I don't want to, like, what if we end up raining
on someone's parade with those and it's going to come across
as pretty ass-holy to be like, hey, fan film,
you should be doing this, you know?
And it's like, why don't you guys make it?
Wow, your production value sucks.
Wow, Jesus.
But I can say they're going to be better than anything
the fucking sequel trilogy has to Office.
So don't worry about that.
I'm just waiting for the next one.
That's going to be insane.
Oh, yes.
Thursday, two women.
What is happening?
Someone hold me.
I'm scared.
You'll be okay, buddy.
You'll be okay.
Make it through this.
There's just six hours to go.
Quite literally, yeah.
Hello, long man.
Whamen and Wolf.
Hello, you.
Mola reviews movie about space wizards for children.
Copper.
That'll be $40,000.
I don't think they could do that.
But, you know, maybe.
Oh, it's just such a weird scenario to even be considering.
Mm hmm.
Damn it, guys.
I had stuff to do today.
Do the stuff.
You could just listen to us in the background.
It'll be fine.
Yeah, but what if he's working with Adio?
Tool is just Smash Mouth for virgins.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my.
I'm going to copy that for Wolf.
And I call it, by the way, every question I've ever said
that I've copied and pasted, they are all in this thing.
And I realize I should have looked for ones that have
anything to do with Jay Longbone.
I think there may have been one.
There's a lot that I'd have to search through.
But, yes, I'll have to search through some.
I'm going for Jay, apparently.
I hope the people who ask these questions
watch every single episode thoroughly.
They know more than we do.
You will get your ads of that, I swear.
And a normal Super Chat for Mauler.
Have a nice day, guys.
Thank you, Eric Stewart.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Good to see that Star Wars girl on Efap.
You're all awesome.
Also, Hi Rags.
He would have said hi.
Hello.
Free Super Chat for Mauler.
I'll give it Mauler.
You're Nazi now.
Would it be okay to make videos named Unbridled Rage
slash praise?
And why do you not like John Wick 2 exactly?
So, firstly, yes, anyone can use the Unbridled Rage
praise thing.
Doesn't bother me.
Go for it.
It's just a descriptive of what's happening in the video.
I'm not patenting that.
You'll be fine.
I think the only thing you'd really have to be worried
about is the people who don't listen to the Efap podcast
will probably go, whoa, man, what a fucking rip off.
You'll probably just have to deal with strangers, you know?
You might have a couple of people saying you're ripping me
off, but I mean, I'm assuming the video is not going to be
the same thing, even if it is as long as you're doing it
well, right?
Like for the different movie.
Right.
It would work out okay.
Pretty much.
All right.
Wait, what was the...
Oh yeah.
Why don't you not like John Wick 2 exactly?
So here's the thing.
I despise John Wick 2, and then I watched John Wick 3
with Fortier, with alcohol, and we laughed throughout
the whole thing, so it was so bad.
Then I've told...
I've said this on Efap before, but I know that this
might be new for a lot of people.
You fast forward a bit, and Metal Commander,
as you guys all know him, he decided he was free one day
and he wanted to chill out, and he asked me if there's
anything new he should watch, and I was like,
oh, he's probably watching you, John Wick.
You'll probably like it, because he liked John Wick 2,
and I was like, yeah, just go for it.
And so he did, and as he was watching it,
he just kept sending me messages like,
this is stupid.
This is fucked up.
This makes no sense.
This is dumb.
What the fuck?
And I was just like, have you put these into like
just a notepad?
And he was like, why?
And I was like, because you've almost sent me enough here
to make a video, and you may as well.
I mean, fucking, nobody talks about how bad the
John Wick sequels are.
And then he was like, well, it's because the second one's
not that bad, though.
And I was like, hmm.
And he was just like, OK.
And then I brought it up with Fringy,
because obviously, he loves John Wick as a franchise.
And he was like, yeah, third one isn't fantastic.
And he referenced like the end of the third one,
where something really stupid happens to John.
And I was just like, there's a lot more than that
that's wrong with that one.
I think we talked about it for a while and broke it down
until he was like, yeah, third one's not very good.
But the first and second are very good.
And I was like, hmm, hmm, hmm.
And he was like, what's wrong with the second one?
And after several conversations, a rewatch with Wolf,
and a lot of what you call dissection with Metal,
Fringy has now concluded that John Wick 2 and 3 are bad.
And the first one's very good.
And Metal is going to make a video for both John Wick 3
and 2, hopefully, given enough time.
And so I don't want to spoil anything.
But it does seem to be a take that hardly anyone
has that John Wick 2 is bad.
And yet, Wolf thought it was fucking terrible.
Fringy has completely turned on it.
Rags even says that it's fun.
It's not very good.
And I know that a shit ton of people
are very much in favor of John Wick 2, so I don't know.
But I still think John Wick, like we rewatched John Wick 1.
And we've looked at arguments against John Wick 1.
John Wick 1 still holds up better than the other two
by far.
And that's like John Wick 2.
I would have to agree with Rags, that it's fun.
But it's not really anything that you
should be looking to in terms of what
it's like to do things right in terms of the writing.
Like that, it was particularly jarring.
Well, I probably shouldn't say too much.
Anyway, it's just a fun movie.
I'm also the kind of guy that also liked Terminator 3,
because I also thought it was a fun movie.
But in terms of story and how they did things,
like retconned a few things.
Judgment days, inevitable.
It's like, oh, Jesus Christ.
But all the practical effects and stuff, characters,
it was a fun movie.
Yeah, Metal will come out with his John Wick 3 video
hopefully within the next month.
And then it was kind of like, depending
on if people actually want to see it,
he'll make a John Wick 2 one as well.
So I don't really want to say anything.
But yeah, look out for those.
It'll be fun.
Anyways, high rags kick Jay and love you, Wolf.
He loves back and rags his high back in spirit.
Unlike Wu-Tang Clan, Efap isn't for the children.
This is true.
Nando is the name of my roommate.
I asked him how he incurred the wrath of the long man and co.
He said he wasn't gamer enough and he's sorry.
Well, if you apologize for not being gamer enough,
I can see an apology there.
Like, I'm all right with it.
You're doing OK.
Thanks for making my 10 hour shift less massive, Uwu.
Why are you going to say the Uwu?
Why are you going to make it weird?
But yeah, no, good stuff.
We'll keep you company.
That means that guy has got what, potentially
two and a half hours left of it if it started
at the exact same time, which is incredibly unlikely,
but possible.
Rags is to mauler as milk is to Bilbo.
That sounds oddly sexual, but I'll take it.
You know, we don't have to look into it.
It's fine.
Here, have some YouTube money.
Thank you.
Watch season one of Buffy.
It was good.
Really, most people don't think it's good.
A lot weirder than I expected.
I'm interested to see what happens next.
Although Willow's boyfriend being a robot was a bit hilarious.
That's the episode.
It's called iRobot.
No, it's a play on iRobot.
I think it's iRobot, you Jane, actually.
It's a play on the Tarzan thing.
Well, I might be fucking that up.
It doesn't matter.
The point is that that episode is possibly
the worst one in the season, and season one is pretty weak.
But it gets really good at around the end of season two
and mostly onward.
Mauler is Trace.
Jay is Fiora or Flora.
Wolf is Keith, Rags is Natani.
Don't ask.
Just read it.
All right, done.
I'm going to assume that's an anime, but it's fine.
Guys, I have real life stuff to do on weekdays.
It's OK.
Just do the real life stuff.
Treat this as a backup for that one day
where you have absolutely nothing to be able to watch.
It could happen.
Mauler, my GF hates Jeb Nichols.
Well, I suppose that makes some sense.
She doesn't appeal to everybody, I guess.
Jeb Nichols is, you know.
You certainly didn't appeal to us, I can say that much.
Yeah.
Free super chat for that writing and rage fellow.
Noted.
It's time for another Jeb Build alt-right incel podcast
with wamens.
Oh, god, the narrative is derailing Joker aside.
How are all you doing?
Oh, sorry, jokes aside.
Yeah, yeah.
Joker aside.
Joking.
It's been, it was an interesting stream.
I think we got a lot of interesting discussion
on Joker out there.
And I just need to keep on drinking things
to make sure I don't die, so it'll be fine.
Longman needs his milk, that sort of thing.
Kathleen Kennedy said Star Wars isn't like Marvel
because they have no source material
to pull from the Star Wars.
They had George Lucas plans, by the way.
Yeah, she shouldn't have said that.
It was really embarrassing because they destroyed the EU.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah, I saw that earlier today.
Like, yes, you did.
You fucked it up.
I like as well.
She's like, it's hard for us, not for you, though.
What the fuck?
A lot of people would argue it's easier
to make your own story instead of adapting one
because then you got to like be really careful.
Yeah, you just got to be careful
with what you've already got there,
which is previous material, of course.
It doesn't need to be written material.
You don't have to go to the books too much.
I think as long as you're just respectful
of the fucking characters
and you don't turn them into losers before murdering them,
I think you could have done okay.
I love that idea, by the way.
It's like, if we had source content,
we'd know not to destroy characters.
Like, oh.
Of course.
This is how that works.
It's my birthday and I got an eFap, best present.
Aww.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.
EFAP, but with two females?
What the hell is this madness?
I thought this was an incel podcast.
I subbed.
Oh.
Well, now you're just gonna sub now, don't you?
No, this is, it was the reveal podcast.
You can have wamen who are incels.
It's fine.
Oh, right.
It's fine.
Okay, please subscribe again and ignore the last one.
EFAP, but with two females, what the, oh wait,
I read that, I don't read that twice.
Such a, it was so good, you had to do it twice.
Morning Massives, Hi Rags.
He would've said hi.
Yes.
Free Super Chat for Rags.
Also Hi Rags.
Oh, I feel bad.
You'll have to,
it was Hi Rags.
You'll have to, you'll have to keep a note,
like of how many Hi Rags we got,
and you have to have him on air, say hello,
like that many times.
You'll just be sitting here for 10 minutes,
just like, hello, hello, hello, hello.
I'm waiting for the time where his thing will unmute,
and he'll be like, you guys are still here?
I'll be like, hey buddy, how you doing?
And we're like, I was talking, why are you ignoring me?
Oh yeah, he fucking mistook the fact
that he's been muted for like five hours.
He's like, oh.
I thought you guys would be in dicks.
Zoo Tycoon is objectively the greatest game ever made.
All right, you hit it here folks.
Zoo Tycoon, I used to play Roller Coaster Tycoon
when I was younger.
Good day, long man.
May the dawn, the jab, and the cosmic chicken
be with you all.
Wishes upon you, sir.
May the dawn bless you.
Congrats on your 75th appearance, Rag.
Also, Advent Calendar is up on website, ready for December.
I mean, yeah, I'll be checking it out.
75th?
Yeah, Rags has guested now 75 times.
We didn't even have 75 episodes.
Well, the minis get included in the movies.
Okay, I can see the logic.
Yes, quick, no time to explain.
Say five words that begin with N.
Uh-oh.
Never.
Ninja.
Ninja poop.
Ninja poop, yeah.
Nope.
Narnia.
And Narnia, there's our five.
Yeah.
Send this freebie to Anna.
Anna's streaming right now, guys.
Go get it.
So we just go to a stream and we donate right to our stream.
Yes, but I will make a note still.
Nando's Nando's, I love Nando's, hashtag Nando's.
All right, someone's super chatted dollar.
Dollar?
Yeah, it just says dollar.
Well, it's a dollar sign, so.
Oh, okay.
All right.
Short and sweet.
This one's a Jay Longbone.
Very well.
Very well.
Weekend, no, weekday eFap, is that legal?
Jeb be praised.
I know.
We're breaking all the rules.
I just saw a Look Up Diabeto Family Guy clip online.
Does Family Guy have a Diabeto joke?
Oh, boy.
Did we steal?
Diabeto's hilarious.
That guy was starving and bored.
Look, Peter, if you're that hungry,
go down to the darkened.
I'm listening to this clip.
I will send you.
Fine, Daddy, and we'll get dinner started.
You're not going to get dinner started.
She's going to tell us sloppy old.
I'm going to have to listen to Importions, guys,
because you know how copyright goes.
Nearly there, though, I'm sure.
Vanish made to do it.
And she will, but only because she needs money
to pay for medicine for her prematurely over.
Nearly to the punchline, I'm sure of it.
Just breaking it up enough.
Maturely overweight son, Diabeto.
Mama.
Gotcha.
Oh, it's.
It's not quite the same joke, but yes, Diabeto,
it does exist in Family Guy.
Yeah, no, in our contact, it's Magneto.
In this, it's a Spanish diabetes kid.
Both work, both work.
I think ours is better because we're better people.
That's my totally fair take.
I'm not biased.
No, no, no, never, ever, ever.
Ever.
Get Aiden, complete the Trinity.
Oh, well, we'll probably do that down the line.
It'll be when we cover Jeb Nichols again.
That's just too perfect of an opportunity to pass up.
I'll title, should I title it the thing?
Every part of this podcast is about Jenny Nicholson.
And then people will be like.
It says it in the title, though.
Oh, my God, I didn't read the rest.
And whoever has the bigger dong keeps this one.
I think Rags will desperately wanna take ownership
if that's the rules, he'll be like.
I have the biggest dong, how dare you?
But he's not here, so I guess we know
who the true biggest dong is.
I love these Jeb, Dawn, and Tonal people.
Yeah, Jeb, Dawn, and Tonal, they kind of,
they make Eve happy, you know?
Very important people.
Every time I, every time I miss,
I hear his name, I miss him all the more.
I see his face everywhere, it's such a legend.
He's been gone now for nearly three months.
I know, it's a bummer, it's a serious bummer.
I hope he's doing okay.
Need the monthly thrusts, man.
Uh-huh, waiting.
Good to see Jay Longbone back.
I've been enjoying all the Batwoman coverage from you guys.
Yeah, like I said.
Her Batwoman videos are fucking great.
Yeah, it's a good companion thing with Efap,
or vice versa, because it's just like,
you jump into her take that I would take.
There's loads of other people,
like that show is really good for watching people watch it.
It's fantastic.
Yeah, I like to watch Jay Longbone's first,
and then I go over to Efap and get the uncut,
director's cut version, whatever you want to call it.
It's pretty great.
We get to look at so many women in this episode.
Also, Anna is my number one celebrity crush.
Fasho.
For show.
Fasho?
For show, for show.
There you go, I got it, nailed it.
Yeah, it's a fair choice.
Though I think Rags would be upset, as would I.
We should be number one, and joint number one, obviously.
Mueller, it won't let me send quotes from no bullshit.
Oh, like in Super Chat, do they censor it?
I'm assuming it's the debate's a gay or whatever.
You can't say gay, that's offensive.
Even though it's accurate, debates truly are the big gay.
Please give this to Jay and then kick him and take it away.
Oh.
Damn.
Damn, yeah.
Fasho.
Just imagine him with like a little cup.
Kick him.
I say that it's fine to Efap early,
just as long as it's within a week apart.
I mean, these won't be a week apart.
We got, we just had one a few days ago,
and we're gonna have another one a few days from now.
We're sorry.
Really, when?
Sunday night.
Afternoon, well, Sunday night.
Afternoon for Rags and Monday morning for Australians,
which should give you a big clue
as to who our guests are gonna be.
Haha.
And we've got the Efap after that already booked.
Um.
So much Efap in this month.
But you see, it's because episode nine
is about to steamroll through Efap, you know?
Oh, yeah.
That'll be the focus.
So much episode nine.
Sorry for asking this again,
but would you guys like to see
the tismy Efap story I wrote?
I think the sleep tisms got you distracted Sunday.
It depends.
If it's like the whole meme story thing,
then just send it through the memes.
But if it's like a full-on book thing,
probably not.
Got like 20 pages.
It really depends.
He got 20 pages in printer paper.
Too whamin'?
You're killing the patriarchy.
Well, if it's so easily killed,
then perhaps it should be killed.
That's good logic, right?
Yeah, we can't have that.
Yeah, I can't have that weak shit.
Mm-hmm.
I got an A on a thesis paper
talking about how shit Ray's character is in TLJ.
She is long man and co.
Hey, not bad.
Oh, I wonder what kind of class that was.
That's pretty cool, actually.
Like, yeah, is it for film or English or something?
Yeah, I have a feeling that
depending on the quality of the writing,
you probably could have gotten an A
if you had said she was a great character
and argued it well enough,
but I don't know.
I just like the idea that the teacher was like,
yeah, she is a shit character, A.
Yeah, which is weird because you don't know colleges
for the takes that actually make sense like that.
Well, you can't criticize that way when you're here
because you were supposed to tow a certain line.
I'm biasing into colleges right now.
Dun, dun, dun.
Fuck Mary Kill.
Kit Master Fisto Fisto.
Kiadi the Daddy Mundi.
Or Dexter Come Dine With Me Jester.
Okay.
Wait a minute, I need, okay, so I know Dexter Jester,
but I don't know these other two.
Kiadi Mundi and Kit Fisto.
My God, not a true Star Wars fan.
Kiadi Mundi was killed by the clones.
Kit Fisto was killed by Palpatine.
Well, I guess you go with fuck Kit Fisto
because you got the anime tentacle thing.
I never saw prequel movie two and three.
I only saw the first one.
Whoa, you didn't see those.
I probably should,
just for the sake that everyone else has, you know?
I mean, yeah, keep you up to date, right?
Like, fucking hell.
Yeah, if I'm gonna be on this podcast and be for reals,
I gotta fucking do that.
You shouldn't have told everyone that.
They're gonna think you're a fraud now.
Yeah.
Yeah, now I'm gonna get kicked.
Shit.
They know the truth, sir.
Yeah, okay, so fuck Fisto.
Makes enough sense, I think.
We got Mary and Kill left.
I think I'm gonna kill Jettster.
It's just, he's too thick for me, okay?
I'm putting it out there.
And he's too grabby with those hands.
And he seems dirty, he doesn't wash a lot,
even though he's wearing a diner,
he just doesn't seem to care.
And that's just not, you know, cool with me.
And then Mary Kiatimundi.
He seemed to care about, you know,
the droid attack on the Wookiees.
And that's genuinely how I feel that he's a good man.
So, yeah, here you go.
Those are my answers.
And you're reading the leaks,
like the Resistance sees hundreds
of Palpatine Star Destroyers.
I heard of hundreds of Palpatines, then my phone died.
And I thought for an entire 10 minutes,
JJ created clones of Palpatine.
Hundreds of Palpatines.
I mean, do you really think that they won't do that?
You know, there's a chance, just saying.
There's, yeah.
Best time catching Efap Live.
You should also check out a Japanese commercial
called Long Long Man.
Could make some good memes with that.
Eman Gameplay, I believe,
made one of the first memes with that.
We showcased it on Efap Live,
and then it ended up in my TFA part two.
It is quite suitable.
It's a good chance.
Wow, Morley, you brought two wamens
on the wamen-hating alt-left-right podcast.
What kind of basement-dwelling incel are you?
Get a girlfriend already.
Why would I do that?
I'm scared of them.
I mean, is Elizabeth Banks wrong?
I don't think so.
Trying to say we can't trust Elizabeth Banks.
That's fucked up.
Saw a joker, knew about everything,
because I didn't care when I watched you guys,
but my GF didn't.
And bro, I was watching my GF,
and Lil Bro React the whole time.
My said, I have a favorite movie now.
Hi, Wagyu.
I'm glad you have a favorite movie now.
Or whoever did say that.
I got a little bit confused there.
It's good shit.
I feel like we're kind of cracking through to that
in these podcasts where we cover
People's Tismy Takes on Joker.
That guy's recommendation for fixing the script,
for example, kind of like, oh my goodness, please no.
But you know, it's how it goes.
I popped back in and saw some segments of this,
like, oh, maybe I should wait for later.
I can't handle the cringe.
Stop.
So.
Think about arguing with,
he really wanted to argue with a girlfriend.
It's like you really wanted Joker to start abusing a woman.
It was insane.
So good news.
Efap the movie is progressing nicely now.
It's going to be nice and long.
Keep up the good work,
and remember to water your jabs.
You'll be very important later.
All right, the Efap movie.
I have no idea what exactly that is,
but color me excited.
Watch it be like the greatest thing ever.
Like no joke.
I am a child watching this stream.
Stole my mommy's card.
Ha ha, pee pee, poo poo.
In the rooftop water closet with the door open
so rags can see.
Oh.
I'm sorry rags.
Surprise Thursday, Efap.
The dawn is smiling upon us all.
Oh, absolutely.
And what a fine smile it is.
Yeah, I wouldn't imagine anything less.
Hi rags, I want to send you the Darth Bane trilogy.
Is there any way?
Um, I will save this for him.
Do, do, in case he has a specific answer for that
that I am not aware of.
Boop, boop, boop, boop.
Also, you guys thoughts on the movie, Troy?
It's my third favorite movie.
Also, hi Anna and Jay Longbone.
I like Troy.
I rewatched it about a year ago,
and I remember thinking, you know what?
Ain't so bad, but maybe I'm unaware
of how bad it really is.
I don't know.
I have fun with it.
I'm not familiar.
Maybe I'll have to go into Seattle around December.
Maybe if, if it's as good as you say, maybe I'll grab it.
It's kind of old movie.
I think it's like 2004 or something, but yeah,
we looked at, sorry.
That's okay.
One of my favorite movies, Collateral, I believe,
was 2001.
Oh no, I just mean, I don't know how easy it'll be
if you find like on a shelf or something, but yeah.
No, I'm not doing it as a shelf.
I'll just find it digitally somehow.
Mm-hmm.
Just came from Rags' video.
We roasted movie, Bob?
Yes.
Oh, we were, you know, five hours ago.
He's never going to come on now, dude.
As if he was ever going to come on, like really?
That's true.
That's true.
So you might as well seal a deal and have some fun, right?
I would love it if he tweets out a screenshot
of the thumbnail and he's like,
these incels made a 10 hour podcast on Murray
and no one cares.
Like, it doesn't get retweeted or anything.
It's just like, go away, Bob.
You should put like one of the diabeto's in the thumbnail.
Dude, if anything on Twitter like that happens,
I'll be like, why would you criticize?
Like, those people drew some fan art.
I just sent him a folder of diabeto.
Bodmer slash Pemdas test.
Negative three plus three times four times five,
exclamation plus six times seven plus eight.
I mean, I can't be doing that shit right now,
but I don't know if it works with both
or works better with one.
I'm assuming that it works the same with both or whatever.
I don't know, I can't remember if there's actually
a significant difference between Bodmer and Pemdas.
That conversation was enlightening.
That was the Aiden stream, actually, but yes.
You.
10 minutes late, so I missed about 1% of the horror.
Yes, unfortunately.
Still.
No, you're just that much more sane.
So much I'd like to say to thank you,
but every time I type the dollar amount goes up.
So thanks for reading this in your monotone voice
because it's going to make you massive.
I don't think I'm monotone.
I think that's an outrageous claim.
See, that's different tones.
Yeah.
God of.
Proof.
Nailed it.
But thank you.
An efap on my birthday, praise be the dawn.
That was from Eman.
Happy birthday, Eman.
We got another birthday.
Yeah.
Happy birthday, Eman.
Mauler, dankmas and real gyms equals good Simpsons vids.
Oh wait, I think it's saying dankmas
and the real gyms have good Simpsons videos.
Fair enough.
I do like me some Simpsons.
Sneaky ones.
What?
They're still going, aren't they?
What are they on there?
Like their 28th season?
Oh, Simpsons.
Yeah.
Jesus.
Yeah, I'm still coming.
Sneaky ones.
I feel like I'm still going.
I feel like I'm still going.
I feel like I'm still going.
I feel like I'm still going.
I feel like I'm still going.
Sneaky ones, you forgot to remind me for this efap.
Oh, we didn't tell anybody about this.
In fact, I was like suggesting it to Rags and Wolf
and then Wolf just like put it on Twitter.
He was just like, oh, efap's happening.
I was like, dude, we don't even know.
Like for sure.
Okay.
You're creating expectations.
That's the worst thing to do.
I'm surprised to watch anime with Theo in two hours
and they need to eat.
By the dawn, why is this on a Thursday?
Regardless, have a fun stream you incels.
Have a fun watch of anime, you, my fellow incel.
I hope it's a good one.
There's not many.
Yeah, there's like three good ones.
The rest of them are terrible.
Hey, Wolf.
It's a subjective thing.
Have you checked out Clamavi de Profundus yet?
I am going to save this question.
It sounds like the big game.
I'm being honest with you.
Yeah.
Like who would read, to be honest.
God, in this current year, Jesus.
What are you guys' thoughts on RVB?
Red versus blue?
Oh, red versus blue.
That's good stuff when I watched it like years ago.
I don't really know what's going on with it right now.
It was pretty, you know, it was quaint.
Later on, they kind of seemed like
they were farting around a lot.
Like they stuck on one joke
and then kind of stretched it out for like too long.
Got pretty bad.
And then Monty Oum showed up
and started animating some of those fight scenes.
Those fight scenes were pretty fucking sick.
And then unfortunately he passed away
and I hadn't really kept up since then.
But RVB had a pretty, it was pretty solid.
One of the funniest thing in the world.
I got some smiles here and there.
I enjoyed my time with it.
Oh, there you go.
I don't know anything about it at all, honestly.
Also, Mueller, I'm serious about need this money for rent.
All right, just keep it for red.
Also, chat, can I get a...
Oh, you fucked up.
Can I get a padarao?
Shit, chat, he wants you to say padarao.
Shoot, I need to fill in the 150 word.
Oh, and he did, there you go.
Bob, I don't go get the rooftop.
Oh, I get it, like the second Bob speaks.
Get that rooftop.
I was gonna finish rewatching the boys tonight.
There's a tonaled 1.2 billion reference in episode one,
but I'm ready for another sleepless night of fapping.
See, that's commitment right there, fellas.
That's what we call commitment.
Hi Rags, thanks Jay for finally booking Anna.
Thanks, oh, again, because he's the manager, that's true.
He's the manager.
How many guests will a movie Bob video take down today?
Also, hi Rags.
Technically, technically, did he get Rags?
Did Rags die between videos or did he die during the?
I felt like he died between, he made it through
and then maybe he kind of had the little death lurch
through his house and then just keeled over.
Yeah, that must've been it.
But he survived just long enough to see it to the end
and then he died.
And then you go, that Star Wars girl took some painkillers,
so that counts as at least a half kill, partial kill.
Wolf took several breaks, so he was like
resurrected several times.
I think that still counts as a kill.
So yeah, movie Bob's doing pretty great, honestly.
Very good record at this point.
The body count keeps going.
Good job, Bob, not gonna take it away from you.
Nobody tell Bob who invented rockets.
Doesn't matter, he deserves to have his robotic body
talking to sentient AI.
I just love the idea that he actually feels
that like the will took that from him
by being lesser than him.
Like, how could he possibly be taken seriously by the left?
Like, shouldn't they consider him to be a fucking idiot?
Ah, I have a hard time with just whether or not
any of this is true anymore.
This is stuff that I hear.
Is Bob a real, is Bob a hallucination?
I know, has Bob been here, has he been placed here
to just test us all?
Because I feel like that's what it is.
Bob Chipman is the Titanic if YouTube,
but not as tragic because everyone knew
this would happen with him.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna stop making videos.
I don't know why escapist would have rehired him.
That's such a weird choice.
Did they can him at first?
I think he went separate ways with them
but then rejoined them, I really don't know.
Cause I know he started out with them, I think, right?
Oop, did I lose you?
No, something went weird.
Hello, am I back?
Am I back?
Yeah.
Excellent, I was just saying.
That was weird, Singapore did that and everything.
Singapore, why?
Yeah, as far as I know, he like left escapist,
started with them, then left them and then rejoined them.
And I just, I don't know.
I guess they really wanted extra content of some kind.
I think you can call that content in some universe.
It's possible.
Yeah, I guess escapist really couldn't say no
because for a while, like in its infancy,
they had plenty of shows and now they've got like two.
I'm just looking at, chat's frozen, it's spooking me.
Yeah, I don't know what was going on here.
I guess the chat kind of felt it too.
Oop, there we go.
Are we good?
All right.
As long as it keeps moving, I know things are alive.
I'd also like to note that Bob made fun of that kid
for whining that life supply of chicken for being fat
despite the fact that he's also fat.
That tweet about the chicken kid was weird.
All about it was weird.
So Bob made fun of a fat kid?
I can't remember specifically.
He was talking about like how the child looks like
a 50 year old, something, something, something,
teamster, I think.
I can't remember.
It was like, Bob,
why would you make fun of a little kid for his looks?
Like you're just inviting a response there.
A very specific response.
Bob, you gotta pick on adults.
Come on, dude.
Morla, my male member is very small
and I've been letting Rah and Rags
double team my boyfriend, Carl,
but here's my question.
And then there's no question.
Strange, but I will allow it.
Rags, I often produce stool samples
with my lab door open for you.
Aw.
See, some people think that's weird.
I think that's kind.
It's considerate that they're-
We chose trust.
Yeah, and they're just trying to let Rags
explore some new stuff.
I don't know, come on.
Okay.
Eight hours has passed.
Yes, we've hit eight hours exactly, actually.
Though I will say our pace on this
is going faster than I expected.
We might be able to get done by 12 hours.
How fucking sad is it?
Like insane is that?
Like you're like, oh, it's going fast.
It'll only be four hours.
Let's fucking do it.
Hi, Wolf, Rags and Morla, take my shackles.
Thank you.
Kathleen Kennedy's calcified queef.
Wow.
Is that a name or just this message?
That's just the message.
It says Cheers Wolf at the end of it.
Oh.
All right, then.
I'm taken by surprise by that.
Congrats, sir.
Taksin has been really weird on Twitter lately.
Yeah, there's been loads-
God, he has.
Loads of tweets about Efap.
Really passive-aggressive, really bitter.
And it's interesting, because like,
I think Jay is trying to straddle a sense of like,
yeah, you know, Taksin cool, we cool, everything cool,
but it's difficult.
A lot of those tweets are coming out.
There was an argument that was like,
oh, we don't get it in relation to Efap.
The arguments are supposed to be bad.
I was like, who the fuck ever said that?
Like, yeah, it was a quote.
I was like, what?
I don't know that anybody's defended Efap by saying,
the arguments are supposed to be bad.
I was just like, okay.
Lots of weird stuff on Twitter, yeah.
Twitter sucks shit, dude.
And yeah, and we still get messages from us.
I was like, you're gonna cover the video on Rags?
Like, I think at this point, like I didn't,
honestly, this wasn't my take at first,
but I'm starting to get really convinced by it.
I think we're dealing with like a standard troll,
like don't feed the trolls sort of situation.
It really seems like that,
because boy, boy, fucking howdy.
I have never seen two people try this goddamn hard
to antagonize somebody that they don't even watch.
It's like, so, I don't know,
it just kind of seems like they're really trying
for attention and it's kind of to the point
where I feel like we shouldn't even just give it to them.
Well, there's the thing.
It may have, it would have worked
if the video did more damage,
but it was just not particularly well-made
and the overall message is Rags has subtle bigotry
and that makes him the worst person on YouTube.
It's like, eh.
Subtle bigotry.
Argument doesn't really follow through there.
And there's loads of like,
there's loads of cut elements to it as well.
There's somebody who's posting like timestamps
and responses whenever there's tweets about it.
It's just funny.
Oh yeah, that was something someone noticed as well
that kind of turned me on this.
They're like, whenever you see a bigger tweet
from tax in relation to eFap,
you'll often find the thread ends with a plug.
Like, hey, check out my video on this.
Hey, check out my channel.
I cover this thing.
They're like, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
So yeah.
Yeah, they're just kind of,
they're saying anything to get a rise.
And it's like, do you really believe that's the case?
It's like, considering I've labeled them
the fucking most dishonest person on YouTube
that I've come across, not a big surprise whatsoever.
So yes, very weird behavior.
And I guess we don't want to encourage it at all,
that behavior, I mean.
Yep.
Gonna stay relatively clear, I suppose.
Oh my God, what the fuck?
Well, I'm back.
Hey, dude.
Yep.
What is that?
What is up?
What happened to you, right?
I had to go, had to go.
Back now, but had to go.
Hey, dude.
Are you in good feelings,
mental and physically?
Is everything all right?
Good, good.
All's well, all's well.
Well, welcome back.
You missed coverage of a particular
Letizumu Joker take again.
We did another one and we looked at memes
and now we're on super chats.
Oh, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
And I'm filler, man.
Yes, and also that Star Wars girl is set to,
she said she will return.
Other than that, you've missed several,
I wanna say like 16 high rags.
Oh my goodness.
I'm gonna have to do one collective hello and return.
Oh my God.
Yes, the Efap 62, the high rags episode.
The Apex hello.
I thought we were gonna get it.
I don't know what's happening.
No, I'll put it, well, I figure with the rest, right?
You know, you get the next one and then it'll be,
because if I just say it now, then it'll be like,
you know, it won't come with, it won't be in a pair,
you know?
All right, we'll save it for the next one.
Here's a free super chat, thank you.
And this next one says kick rags, also high rags.
Hello.
There you go.
There you go.
Feels good to have him go.
It's so much more natural that way, you know?
You can never use too much lube, dildo ragons.
Yeah, it's a strong quote.
It's an undying quote.
Rags, this just says rags I will pay you to stop.
I don't know what it's referring to.
Well, you heard the man stop.
Oh, right.
When you were talking the super sexualisms
at the beginning of the stream, I think.
Oh.
I don't think that ever happened.
I know those little, those little stamps are adorable.
Holy shit.
Yes, they are.
And they don't show up on the re-chatted chat.
It's bullshit.
YouTube needs to.
Oh, why?
It's downright wrong.
I'm sick of this.
I call disms.
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
Let's scroll and look at some of these memes.
Some of them are quite good.
Do you think Ryan was going Kennedy His Johnson?
Do you think Ryan was going Kennedy His Johnson?
If that means sexual favors from Kennedy for Johnson,
who knows what's going on?
Hollywood is a weird man.
And Kennedy is Johnson.
That's a weird one.
That's a weird one.
It is a weird one.
Undeniable.
That's not safe for legal reasons.
I was about to say, like, is he assassinating the Johnson?
I don't know.
That's the complication of words, the English language.
You never know.
I feel like Jar Jar is somewhere in the basement
chained to the floor responsible for writing the sequels
in exchange for his freedom and redemption.
Possible.
I'm not gonna say that that's what was in the leaks,
but something similar to that, I'd say.
George Lucas?
No, no, Jar Jar.
He's writing the films
and he's in the films writing the films.
Like, it's gonna be this whole thing.
Oh, lol, man.
Holy shit, can you imagine?
Like, they've killed all the characters.
All they have left is to bring Jar Jar back
and then kill him.
We actually made a thing about that.
Like, Jay said he'd be really sad
if they brought him back just to kill him.
We'd be like, hey.
It's okay, he's only better that way.
That's basically what they've done with C-3PO.
Yeah.
They've only brought him back to kill him.
Done pretty much with everybody.
Well, yes.
Hello, Metal, he's woken up.
Hey.
He's on the end shift, as one says, with eff up.
McMuffin's for everyone.
Or maybe two.
How much do they cost these days?
Waiting for Charlie's Angels review.
Don't let Drinker be alone.
I don't even wanna fucking touch that movie.
Drinker actually did a Charlie's Angels review.
Yeah, I know, I saw it.
It's funny.
Charlie's Angels.
The film seems fucking terrible.
Wolf, if you could DLT the ST,
but you had to be KKs,
delete the sequel trilogy,
but you had to be KKs?
He has to belong to Kathleen Kennedy?
Kathleen Kennedy?
You could...
Oh, you have to be her.
Oh, no, I ain't gonna be her.
Yeah, no.
Well, wait, what if he becomes Kathleen Kennedy,
but then he uses her responsibly
and then writes a better movie?
No, I guess that's up to Wolf.
Then you live in a world where we have good Star Wars movies
and you're Kathleen Kennedy.
Well, you know, you gotta take one for the team.
You can?
Yeah, yeah.
As long as somebody does,
someone take the bullet.
I've never seen internet historian
and Moeller in the same room.
I mean, he and I sound very differently.
I don't really get the impression
how people are seeing my voice in him as the same,
but, you know,
we can't possibly be,
we can't record together.
I did try to invite him
and he said he can't possibly make it to an eFap
and any public platform with me at the very same time.
That's obviously because we are very much different people
and we have different schedules.
That's all.
It has nothing to do with anything else.
You guys are just conspiracy theorems.
That's all that is.
Ridiculous, ridiculous.
Pool boy for a year, would you do it?
What?
Pool boy for a year?
Why, why?
Is that the whole super chat?
Yeah, just as a pool boy for a year, would you do it?
No.
Pool boy, so are you cleaning somebody's pool?
Yeah, but what's the-
What do you think a pool boy does?
Oh, they sent this,
these super chats are broken up
and they're between other ones of their own.
Like there's a gap.
Oh, of course.
It's so, it makes it so simple.
It makes it so easy.
I'm pretty sure they could have sent this in one,
but I guess not.
So the idea is,
see, I actually thought that you have to be
Kathleen Kennedy was more interesting,
but then I guess this is another question.
So what do you think, Rags?
You get to delete the sequel trilogy,
which by the way,
it doesn't necessarily guarantee any good Star Wars content.
It just means you're deleting some crap stuff.
But in exchange,
you have to be Kathleen Kennedy's pool boy for a year.
Would you do it?
Oh, got it.
Okay, that makes more sense.
Ooh.
Ooh.
You must pay pretty well, right?
That would pay well, probably.
I assume so.
Man, but she would like,
she'd probably like ruined pools, you know?
Like she ruined Star Wars for me.
She's like that person where she walks,
things just crack and burn and turn black.
And she's like, oh no,
this again was-
She's like Godzilla walking through the city
or things just melt and-
That, yeah, I think there's a Simpsons episode
where like Mr. Burns like holds a flower and it just dies.
Is that sort of thing?
It's like maybe the water,
she repels water,
the water doesn't want to run around her.
Yes, just everything.
She can't jump into water
because she'll just hit the bottom of the pool.
Immediately, it runs away from her in fear.
You see the water crying.
So instead, she has to fill the pool with acid
and then it all evens out
and there's a problem for cleaning.
Yeah, then Scrappy-Dee jumps in.
Fuck that little shit.
Oh shit, yeah, the Scrappy-Doo memes.
God, it feels like a lifetime ago.
All right.
I like some of these memes though.
Yeah, I know, it's good shit, right?
Yeah, some of these are really good.
Wolf, I recently longmaned the entire
Lord of the Rings trilogy extended edition in one sitting.
I have to agree with a closer look
that Helm's Deep is celestially epic.
He would very much agree with that.
In fact, Wolf might even describe it as bone-chilling.
Bone-chilling.
Admiral Holdo is a Kathleen Kennedy insert.
I mean, I could believe that.
They almost look similar.
Like if you do the hair down, maybe.
Maybe, I can just, I'm just gonna say it.
I believe it, I believe it.
That's as far as I'm going with that.
Oh man, if that turned out to really be the case,
like if there was an email leaked or a sump man,
that would be so fucked up.
I'd believe it too.
But this whole trilogy, this whole terrible trilogy
was just in service to her cinematic fantasy.
That would be Eagle Jedi.
Have fun and work, Mr. Metal.
He said he's gonna see us flip-flops later.
Pretty racist, but okay.
No sources.
She had Star Wars episode seven through nine
lined up by Lucas.
Yeah, but they ditched all of it
and they couldn't exactly bring his episode nine back in
once they've made a completely different seven and eight,
but she's still wrong, like.
Watch him, watch him do an episode nine
that just randomly gives some other film.
There's a whole set of new characters.
Oh yeah.
The fucking opening crawl is just like
previously on Star Wars.
And it just shows like a bunch of clips
from people we've never seen before.
And it's like, get to the reactor.
We don't have enough time, Sheila.
Gonna have to go alone.
We're like, what the fuck is this?
She can't handle it anymore, Captain.
I don't know what's going on, but thank God.
Yeah, it just shows like Luke B, heroic.
And then he just looks at the screen and he's like,
it's fine, we're okay, we're okay.
Don't worry, good.
And that's why Jar Jar is missing from the new ones.
I'm not sure what that's referring to,
but I think he knew better than to turn up
into the sequel trilogy.
I don't speak too soon.
He's alive, he's probably alive.
Dude, I hope he's on a beach living at large.
Jar Jar doesn't need no sequel trilogy.
He's doing great.
He's in some swamp somewhere.
I like those disgusting gungans.
They like their swamps, so they're like ogres.
He's swimming around, talking to bushes.
Yeah, kind of getting a little crazy in the head.
Yeah.
And then a fucking storm trooper just comes in,
shoots him in the head because he's a character
that exists and he has to die.
The second he's entered into the trilogy,
he just gets sliced apart and blown to pieces.
It turns out Jar Jar was the mole and now he's dead.
And then it'll just be like, oh my God,
he was a clone the whole time.
And you're like, wait, what, what, what?
It's like, sir, they seem to be happy
when we don't kill him.
It's like, bring him back, bring him back.
I just love that you're flushing Akbar
out the fucking window,
and then they're just like, fans aren't happy with this.
And I can just picture Kathy,
Kathy, and Ryan Johnson being like, why?
I don't understand.
I don't get it.
I just don't get it.
Why don't they like our Star Wars movie?
Are they sexist?
Why don't they like our vision?
I used to love Star Wars.
Now it's depressing.
Well, you try and, it's like Joker.
Used to be a tragedy.
Now it's more of a comedy.
TLJ was a tragedy.
Episode nine is the comedy.
Wasn't Joker two announced recently?
Yes.
Okay.
You pessimistic about that, huh?
I just feel like it didn't need a sequel.
I don't know the,
I don't know if that prevents it from getting one.
I just hope it's good.
Yeah, well, let's really cross our fingers on that one.
I agree.
It's much more at risk with a sequel
than there is with one film.
Yeah, I think it's going to be pretty hard to match up.
Pretty sure as well, if it does well,
he's going to get more power to me.
I'm pretty sure they even said he's got a potential deal
to make another DC film other than Joker two.
And you realize if he's successful
with either one or both of those,
he's going to get his own DCU.
Dang, dude.
And like, I find that.
He can pull it off.
That's amazing.
Yeah.
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
I can see Ross saying, no, it wasn't.
No, it wasn't.
Oh my God.
I think we may have gotten something wrong.
I don't know.
Apparently, Ross said that Todd Phillips denied the reports.
I'm going to have to look into that.
Oh, okay.
Well, yeah, no, fair enough.
I already read, I still would like an article about it.
I don't know for sure.
Yeah, I saw it this morning.
I'm like, oh, come on, man.
So I guess, yeah, I guess that was a lie.
Maybe not.
Yeah, I kind of hope they don't.
I mean, recent Hollywood has made me kind of.
I would actually say that is the very reason
why I actually want it.
It seems to be one of the very few remaining lights of hope
for a potential movie that's better than garbage.
So go for it.
If it's terrible, I'll always have the first Joker anyway.
It's true.
The thing of it is, it's like,
I just feel like when something gets really popular,
a lot more people want to meddle with it
and then they fuck it up.
Yeah, I think that's fair.
That's just kind of how it's been for a while.
It'll be something to worry about.
Because it's pretty high with cinematic universes.
They just, if they just let them make a good movie,
it might be really good, really good, but.
I'm actually more on board with giving them
another DC character to do a movie for.
Yeah, that'd be nifty.
And it's only like very lightly tied in with the Joker.
Sure, yeah.
Put it in that universe, I guess.
Have some references there.
And I don't know what we're going to do with it.
This is the thing.
I don't want to tell the man his business.
He made a good movie.
I give him full credit to see if he can do it again.
And I hope he can if he does.
Anyway,
not censoring Joker.
What is he thinking?
Yeah, I know.
He'll actually write the word Joker without censoring it.
Like, as if we haven't had to deal with enough today.
Like, geez.
That's quite the doggone.
Don't write insensitive.
I've seen that a good half a dozen times now.
That's crazy that people will censor Joker.
Well, I think that has.
It's the new N word.
Yeah, really.
But I think that has to do with the censored words
on YouTube, that list that we read.
And Joker's on there.
So I have to imagine they're trying
to keep the monetization up.
These are tweets.
Huh?
Oh, tweets.
Well, now I just don't fucking know.
Yeah, that's what you can monetize tweets
and I need to get back.
Yeah, I think we're going to introduce both Facebook
and Twitter was supposed to be introducing
some kind of monetization thing.
I don't know how that would work.
I imagine putting ads on tweets.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
It's bad enough.
You know, right?
That actually feels like that'll happen.
Honestly, thinking about it.
You can view this tweet in five seconds.
You know what's funny, though,
is some people will have embedded videos
and their ads on it before the video starts.
So we're kind of already there.
Yeah, that's probably what it is, yeah.
Yeah.
Anyway, isn't Palpatine's deal is that no one
can break free from the dark side?
TLG defenders love arrogance,
but this is the one time I'd use that argument
against the sequels.
No one can break free from the dark side.
Vader did.
Yeah, I was going to say whether or not Palpatine
thinks that we know it's not true, I guess.
Yeah, we have an example.
Efab bad.
I've never watched it and I don't watch it,
but I know it's bad because Longman bad.
P.S., hi, wags.
Yeah, that's fair enough.
Hello, hello, hi there.
And Anna. We are bad, though.
J. Longbone, Wolfie, and Meow-er.
Hello.
Meow-er.
Have a bone, wags.
Oh, thank you.
Only clowns can say the J word with a hard R.
My bones.
Only clowns can say the J word.
Like, cloud is like a very serious label.
Are you a cloud? Prove it.
Usually, you have to squeeze your nose.
It goes, brr, brr, brr, brr.
But you're like, okay, good.
That's the test.
Honk, honk.
Could you do episode nine, Efab, in a special way?
We have multiple guests changing, like in 50,
all talking about how they love the movie.
I mean, we'll do one free episode nine,
but I don't think we're going to be doing
anything specifically special for it outside
of just talking about that shit, you know?
Yeah, I can't imagine we'll do another 24-7 one,
or 24-7.
Fucking hell.
24-7.
Oof.
That'll be the most expensive spare beds
on fucking Efab.
You heard about the 24-hour Efap, 24-7 Efap.
That'll be Efab episode 1,000.
And it'll be that I literally sleep in alternating
like 12-hour portions, you know?
Like, we start upstream, then I go to sleep,
and you guys have to carry it.
Or we all just go to bed, and we leave it on
for eight hours, and nobody's talking.
We let anybody come in and go out, let their leisure.
We fucking leave the invite open,
and just people from chat pour in,
like, I want a comment on the video.
Ah, Drunken Peasants is in chat.
Hello there.
Hello there.
Yes, it is eight hours, but in fairness,
how long have we been doing super chats now?
Is it two hours?
Yeah.
We started six and a half hours, right?
What was it?
Yeah, that's about right.
So yeah, we've been doing super chats for two hours, okay?
So it's not a crazy long stream.
It's your average, standard, normal six-hour stream.
Everyone has those.
This has average.
Here's a free super chat.
Our average is above average.
Rags.
Hello.
Destiny 2 is free on Steam.
Efab, oh, that ends with a full stop.
I don't know if, do you care about that?
Right.
Destiny 2 is free on Steam.
Full stop.
There's more to it, but it's not.
Oh, I thought there were, oh, okay.
I thought there was more.
I was waiting for the more of it.
I'm aware that it is on Steam, yes.
No, there you go.
I'm too old for streams.
I don't really have much.
Yeah, I don't really have an interest and...
Kind of, I just, I don't care about Destiny 2.
I've heard it's gotten better,
but I guess I'm just not interested enough
to delve back in.
I am happy for those who like Destiny 2
because it looks like it's gotten better
ever since Bungie went their own way, so cool.
Yeah.
And then it follows up with Everwatch Hippo Zone.
Hippo Zone?
Hippo Zone.
I'm gonna guess no for all three of us.
And then it ends with you and I will poop on the same seat
at the same time, looking in each other's eyes.
Can three people fit on the same?
I think they mean specifically you.
You and them.
Yeah.
The two of us, so, well, still,
I guess that makes things slightly more doable, but...
It's a big seat, I guess.
You can fit two butts on there.
It can be kind of awkward, but I mean, Rags,
are you refusing this offer?
I'd rather...
No, I don't think I will join you.
All right.
The mutual poo.
This, no, I wanna poop alone
and with no one else around me.
Also with the door closed.
Yeah, I am.
That's Denial right there.
He is denied.
I'm gonna deny this pooch-ule with you.
Pooch-ule.
Sub beaches, love y'all.
Why, thank you, but a kind.
Oh, hello, bitch.
This is money.
It can be exchanged against goods and services.
Also, Hi-Rags.
Oh, hey.
Please do an eFap where Batman eats toothpaste.
What?
Did we just reenact that?
Does he have bad teeth?
Are we covering an episode of some series?
Or a movie where he does this?
I don't know.
Is this, maybe this is some kind of like porn parody thing.
With like toothpaste and Batman?
Yeah, why not?
Where he sticks a tube of toothpaste up his bat bone.
Hey, man, even if you're doing porn,
it's good to have clean teeth.
He's referring to eating it
and it's very specific fetish, but don't judge, I guess.
Okay, good stuff.
You should cover Robot Head's review of Mandalorian.
They have him come in, wait, sorry.
Then have him come in to talk about it afterwards.
Well.
Well.
Funny you should say that.
Did he make a hot take?
He definitely had a hot take.
He got like 50% dislike on his video.
Yeah, it was not a video.
And that's Robot Head.
He's a crowd pleaser in terms of people like him a lot.
So he must have said something.
Oh, yeah.
Also, Hi-Rags.
Hello.
Hello, all my n-words.
Hello.
Hello.
Hippoman bad.
I cannot confirm if that is true,
but it sounds agreeable.
I will say that.
Swole PSA sitch or ditch called Murdoch Alt-Right Propaganda.
Who's Murdoch? Murdoch?
I don't know who that would be.
Did he say sitch that called somebody this?
It says PSA ditch, but I assume they mean sitch.
Huh.
Well, if S becomes D, what becomes M?
Maybe it's not Murdoch.
Maybe it's Lurdock.
Oh, Lurdock's an asshole.
Yeah, I agree.
Alt-Right Propaganda.
Lurdock.
Fucking Lurdock.
I don't know.
I don't actually know who you're referring to in this tweet.
No, I'm afraid I don't either.
Rags is the Don confirmed.
Oh, I don't want to, I don't want to fill those shoes.
Yeah, those are hard shoes to fill, man.
That smile can't be beat, cannot be replicated.
Well.
How am I Alt-Right leftist Nazi communist today?
We are great comrade.
Yeah, I mean, it seems
contradictory to sort of people.
It's not though.
You can hold views that contradict each other
at the same time.
You just have to sort of not think about it.
That's all.
Rags makes my pee pee up.
Also, hi, Wags.
Hello.
Rags was a Bosso Zoku rider, now confirmed in law.
Bosso Zoku?
I don't know.
Isn't that one of the names of the stamps?
One of the stamps.
Yeah, you know those little doggo stamps
that YouTube lets you put up?
No, it's the same.
So, Bosso Zoku is a Japanese youth subculture
associated with customized motorcycles.
See, and he knew that off the top of his head
because he's definitely that.
Yeah, I knew that off the top of my head.
I definitely didn't.
Here, I couldn't have googled it
because I don't know how to spell it.
Yeah, well, there you go.
It's proof.
Dude knows our Wags better than we do, apparently.
Yeah, we need to work on that.
I didn't know that.
Incoming weird vomit, buckle up, buckaroos.
Buckle up, buckaroos.
That was weird vomit if we're referring to movie.
Oh, yes, yes.
The alien they meet with at the beginning of TROS
is called Boolio, according to the latest leaks.
Also, Snoke was just a pawn as well.
Oh, of course he was.
Ah, Boolio.
I thought much they'll probably keep telling us.
Snoke doesn't matter.
And it's like, guys, you told us he matters.
Stop saying he doesn't matter.
He clearly fucking mattered.
Like the idea that they're like,
he's just a powerful guy who, you know,
resurrected the empire.
You're like, stop saying that.
He's just a powerful guy who resurrected the empire.
It's an extremely powerful force user.
He's fucking trained Kylo Ren
and caused the downfall of Luke Skywalker
and created the first order.
What?
Yeah, it's important.
Been too long since I caught a livestream
with Star Wars Girl.
Also, hello, all good to make it.
Hello, all good to make it.
Oh, hello, all good to make it.
Good to make it.
Hello.
You nailed it.
You lost.
Hello, fellow humans and rags.
Random question.
What kind of audio setup do you have?
Microphone, mixer, interface.
Voice sounds really clean.
Love from Finland.
I just used an AT2020 USB
and it just plugs into the computer.
And that's all I'm using.
I don't have a mixer or anything like that.
That might be my next step to the next thing to kind of get.
But right now it's just a mic
plugged right into the back of the PC.
I have an AT2020 XLR
and it goes into a Behringer mixer that's quite small.
It's a compact one because I don't need a lot of options
when I'm controlling everything up here.
It does everything I need it to.
And then that goes into the PC.
We're on similar setups.
I know that Wolf has a similar setup.
I believe Forteer and Metal have the exact same setup I do.
And Smiler Elders.
And I have an AT2020 USB as well.
I have a pop filter too.
I don't know if that counts, but that's there.
And my schnauzberries taste like schnauzberries.
Mm.
Kick rags, also Hymola.
Hello.
Hey.
They said kick you rags.
Kick me.
You gotta make an oof.
You gotta make a big old wolf sound.
Angry wolf.
An angry wolf sound?
I don't know if I've ever done that.
I guess it would be a growl.
I don't know.
No, I don't know if I've got it in me.
I'm not really, I'm not that, I'm not that angry.
It's okay.
It's just, it's just a meme.
Can't be angry at a meme.
You can handle it.
MovieBob, I'd rather floss out my urinary tract
with salt-encrusted barbed wire
than listen to one more of that massive orphan's
page-long sentences again.
Salt-encrusted barbed wire.
Oh my God, I actually felt it.
Salt-encrusted barbed wire.
To be fair, that's a, that's a Candian effort.
But yeah, that, there's no fucking way
I would go for that instead of listening
to one page-long sentence from MovieBob.
I just have different preferences.
I know, everyone is subjective, I know.
But yeah, that's, you know.
Have you seen Sargon of Akkad's video
on the politics of Starship Troopers?
I don't normally watch him, but it's the best video
on Starship Troopers on YouTube.
I mean, I really wanted, I've said this before,
I really want him to discuss Starship Troopers
with Red Letter Media, and it's never gonna happen,
but the takes are so different,
and I wanna see what happens on which side
would reconcile information or not.
You know what I mean?
I don't know if it would come to an impasse or something,
but yes, I quite enjoyed his video on Starship Troopers.
I find it all very interesting.
The discussion on Starship Troopers as a whole, I mean.
We get to look at women, that's true.
That's true.
That's Star Wars Eggers.
Look, it's a women if you can't look at her, yeah.
Yeah, there was a bit of Star Wars girl echoing throughout,
but I think we nailed most of it.
It's fine, it's all right, it's all right.
Moolman, the channel Astartis got hacked.
He makes super high quality animations
that you should check out.
I actually essentially have now,
because there was a meme video that was essentially that,
just with all of our faces on top of it,
so technically I've seen that Astartis video,
or at least that one, yeah.
There are only a minute each you should bring attention
to them and help get his channel back,
has he still not got it back?
I would assume it would have been solved.
How long has it been gone?
Let me check, because I know another,
I think Major Kill was another one
that both Warhammer channels, which is kind of weird,
but let's see.
Um, I mean, the channel name is still Kyo, about,
yeah, I don't know.
I hope that, yeah, I can't say,
I assume that it is, because the channel name is different.
But nothing, like all the videos are there,
it doesn't look like any community posts have been made.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, there's,
the whole truth about the Astartis incident is in this post.
You fools once accused this guy
that he steals the channels.
Channels are stolen by an organized group of hackers,
which of course you will never catch.
What do they do with hacked channels?
Correctly, sell it.
Mr. Crazy is just one of those who legally bought
this channel, by the way,
if the real owner of this channel gets in touch,
then Mr. Crazy is ready to consider a deal with him.
This guy, um,
okay.
The whole channel's ransom?
What a disgusting piece of shit.
Who would do that?
What a terrible thing to do to somebody.
Wow.
Well, remember, Rags, there are no bad tactics
or any bad people to throw them out.
Bad targets.
Movie ball would approve of that
as long as you do it to the right people.
Man, some people are just fucking disgusting.
Little bit, yeah.
Um, I don't think you read my last super chat massive.
Why do people do this to me?
Like, if, look, if ever I don't read the chat,
don't set another one to say, go read it.
Just say what you said.
Now I gotta figure out if this is from,
cause I haven't missed any from today or the other day.
And I, you don't understand how many pages
I've got to load and control F just to find if,
and then I don't even know if it's the right one or not.
It just, just, it's, I, it, just next time,
if I miss it, if I miss a super chat for any reason,
and maybe it was blocked, maybe it was retracted.
There's a couple of those that get that treatment.
And obviously I just don't read them out cause,
you know, there's nothing to read,
but just throw in the thing in the thing
and then I can read it out.
Mueller, I'll eventually get you to say the n-word,
maybe not today, or even next DFAT, but mark my words.
I will you, oh, nooga, eh,
yeah, you're not gonna get me with that one.
Also, women bad, please go home.
What?
I can't, I can't wait until the lore expands
and Mueller says the n-word.
I mean, I gotta get permission off C-3PO.
Who's gonna, yeah, are you gonna say it first or C-3PO?
I love that beaver, he's staring at it on the knife
and sweating.
Those Sith, they were evil.
And a baby Yoda squeal, yeah, she's really into baby Yoda.
I think that's fair.
Also, yeah, we got another episode coming today, I believe.
Should be out in like 10 hours or so, I think.
Very nifty.
An episode of Batwoman or?
Mandalorian.
Yes.
No, Batwoman's not out now until December 1st ranks.
Yeah, I thought I, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I thought it was on hiatus.
Another week.
Also, Jay Longo said she won't be covering
Crisis on Infinite Earths.
And I was like, fuck that, we're covering it.
Yeah, boy, we're not gonna know what the hell's going on
and nothing will seem any different.
And if it's, if it leaves on a cliffhanger
and we find out that you have to watch like episode,
whatever of Superwoman to know what happens to Batwoman,
there's a good chance we might even do it.
We've got to keep in continuity
with our favorite character, Batwoman.
Otherwise, what the fuck are we?
Let's be honest.
What if it makes more sense than any of the other shows
or any of the other episodes?
I mean, maybe it will.
I don't know.
It's gonna be exciting.
Maybe it will.
Death is the sequel to life only if you see it.
I think that should have ended with
if you interpret it that way.
Yeah, I think so.
I get the message, though.
Efap interrupted me when I was actually fapping.
Aw.
I mean, it should only encourage, I think.
You should be fine.
Instant command.
First Super Chat, sub-massives.
Ever read the Republic Commando books?
No, I'm afraid.
No, no, I have not.
D Plus should do a live or animated series
on those under the Legends banner.
Use the books as a screenplay, target it at adults.
I mean, there's nothing they can't do, really.
Oh, Disney Plus.
We'll have to see, yeah.
And adult Star Wars, like a porno?
I mean, why not?
Go for it, Disney Plus, do it.
Yeah.
Do all of the things.
You never know what'll work.
Can we outlaw the accent?
I can't stand Morley Blob.
I don't think you can outlaw the Boston accent.
Morley Blob?
The Boston accent is not outlawable, I'm afraid.
Boston?
Yeah, Morley Blob, though, whew.
Morley Blob.
Morley Blob.
Morley Blob.
Wolf, Rey is better character than anyone
from Lord of the Rings, change my mind, XD.
JK, I love Lord of the Rings, just want your reaction.
I'm about to say, I think you'd change it
with a golf club.
Yeah, he'll be upset by that,
but I'll try and read it out for him the next time he's here.
Like I said, I've got all these questions.
Look at this one.
Gary, say baby girl is a naughty girl.
That's for dude Rotic, whenever he comes back on here.
Do you know how awkward that's gonna be?
Gary, the super chat requires it.
You know, with all the people who watch Star Wars
and all that, there is at least one person
who thinks that Rey is a better character
than anyone in the Lord of the Rings.
Is someone out there who believes that?
Law of, what is it, Poe's Law or Murphy's Law?
Whichever one means that if it can, it will.
The law, Poe Dameron's Law?
No, no, if it can happen.
Poe's Law is that just because,
if a woman tells you that you were wrong,
this confirmation you were right all along,
it's Poe's Law.
I think it's Murphy's Law.
Murphy's Law is anything that can go wrong with-
Do you mean like law of averages, or?
Anything that can go, oh, you're right, will go wrong.
I mean, we could apply Murphy's Law to that,
because that would be something going wrong.
Law of numbers.
No, I just mean, if someone concluded that Rey
was better than every character in Lord of the Rings,
that would be an example of something going wrong.
That would be going wrong.
But I don't think it's happening.
But I don't think it's how people really use Murphy's Law.
You really impressed Raw with that golf club thing.
That's bullshit.
The golf club thing?
Yeah, I was saying like somebody said,
Rey is a better character than all the Lord of the Rings
characters changed my mind.
I said, well, Wolf would probably want to do that
with a golf club.
True.
He's in a golf club?
And we hit all of his friends with-
No, he hit the guy with a golf club.
No, he hit the guy with a golf club
until his mind was changed about Rey being better
than Lord of the Rings characters.
Oh, yeah.
So this one just says, he would just become
Jenny at the foot of the snow.
Jenny at the foot of the snow?
Yeah, I'm not sure what to make of that.
Hmm.
These out of context, efap comments, you know?
I don't know what to say.
S-N-O-W?
Mm-hmm.
I don't know, maybe it's snowing where Jenny lives
and he's letting us know.
I have no idea what that means.
The Twitter mob are gonna call you guys red-pilled,
racist, sexist for talking about something
other than the video, you utter massives.
I was just saying, like if MovieBob tweets this stream out,
who's gonna give a shit?
And be like, are they talking about MovieBob too?
We're not gonna care.
We're just not gonna give a shit.
No.
Just not gonna give a shit.
Finally started reading A Game of Thrones
for the first time, didn't see the show,
but know all the spoilers, 300 PG in, full pages in.
Good so far and grateful the chapters are short.
Hope you enjoy it, have fun.
Yeah, wasn't that a meme where people who read the book
could tell the red wedding was coming
and people who watch the show you could tell
they didn't read the books?
And then there was like subreddits discussing
the show from a book perspective
and then the book people eventually were like,
yeah, we don't even know the cheats anymore,
this is gonna be great, everything's new now
and look how that turned out.
It's gonna be fun.
It wasn't.
Spoilers.
It was a fucking disaster, it was.
Diabeto is an Avengers level threat for certain.
Yep.
I hope they take him seriously, man.
It's gonna be a really good movie when it comes out.
I am personally looking very much forward to it.
Did you see how many donuts he can float, dude?
It's fucking over, dude.
Remember that piece of art
with all those people he's floating?
Like that's like 100 people or some shit.
It's pretty impressive.
Yeah, and girthy too.
The power itself, I mean.
All right.
Whoa, two women to look at?
Someone call Major Lee.
I can't believe Major Lee refused to debate
Geeks and Gamers, man.
That would've been.
He did?
Yeah, like they do this thing called Common Ground.
No, I think there's two episodes of it,
but I think they wanna do more,
where Jeremy will allow the people who hate him the most
to come and talk to him personally through Ryan.
Like he contacts and get it all sorted out.
And apparently they invited Major Lee and he refused.
When was this?
What were they gonna talk about?
Well, the fact that Major Lee made a video
on the fandom menace, right?
So I think that they were gonna talk about that, I guess.
I don't really know.
Oh, I see.
I just went to his channel really quick.
Okay.
But yeah, I just find it kind of amusing
that like I would've thought he'd want to, you know?
Bob tweeted an hour ago in response to someone telling him
he was being roasted.
Really?
Let's have a look, see.
Good old Bobbitt.
How long it would take to roast someone of his size.
How could you say such a thing?
Inside would always be fucking raw.
That's fucking true, that is.
Let's see, two hours ago.
Let's see, two hours ago.
It's probably too late.
Where's the Bob sauce?
I'm actually looking for the Bob sauce.
Red pill alt right in cell Nazi misogyny podcast
of the women hating division.
My goodness.
Oh, 13 hours, I've gone too far.
Oh no.
Oh, I just saw this as somebody saying
that feel when you were definitely not into eugenics
as a sort of thingy.
And I guess the tweet is,
I prefer to simply see it in terms of natural selection
in the new era of intellectual slash creative fitness.
That's what Bob Shippman said.
And he said natural selection is the opposite of eugenics.
You can't get more opposite
than we should manipulate breeding
in order to control population development
than natural selection.
I even invoked both Nazis
and present day Nazi sympathizers on the other side
to clarify this.
Bob, you're not escaping the fucking comments
you've made previously.
Good luck with that shit.
Your vile hatred has brought you full circle.
Well, I mean, you wouldn't think.
It's funny because he's round.
You wouldn't think he ever thought you would escape it.
He would have thought that what he had said
on that shit, that he'd be like, well, yeah.
He's like, oh, maybe I shouldn't defend eugenics.
What the greatest look in history.
He was like, no, I movie, Bob, I cannot be wrong.
Yeah, maybe I'm missing it.
I'm just looking for Elon Musk.
All right, well, oh my God.
He's recently released merchandise for big picture.
What would that even be?
The shirts come in sizes extra, extra large.
It's just the logo, the big picture on a T-shirt.
Why would anyone buy that?
So you can identify your fellow allies
when you're out in public.
Comrades.
Yeah.
So you can hate the poorest together.
So someone said at the movie, Bob,
you're being roasted as a meme on Efep right now.
And he said, oh, that's nice.
I'm keeping a family member company overnight in hospital
while they recover from surgery.
So I suppose we all had important priorities this evening.
That doesn't work, Bob.
Yeah, that would, you would have to say
that we had something else to do in place of it.
And you can't guilt trip us after the shit
that you said on fucking public.
You can't get away with that shit.
Not gonna work.
Not gonna work.
You had, you would have had seven billion chances
not to pull that card before.
That's a, you know, in all seriousness,
I hope the family member is okay, but fuck movie, Bob.
He's a piece of shit.
He's also feeding orphans and collecting boulders.
Yeah, and besides the memes were very positive.
We made him a super villain, but still super.
Yeah, it's odd.
He wanted all along to be a super person and Uber mince.
And we gave him a really fantastic sleeping solution.
He advocates the genocide of people who think differently.
And then he's like, hey,
I've got a family member in hospital.
You're like, what the fuck?
Nice fucking drive.
Those pesky Nazis gave you jettocks a bad name.
Oh, no.
Anyway, Wilford Brimley is the real Diabeto.
I love Wilford Brimley's name because saying it,
well, sort of speak,
because who talks while I go to Wilford Brimley?
Wilford Brimley.
I think a great name too.
Wilford Brimley.
Wilford Brimley.
We'll listen tomorrow.
Wait, sorry.
In the origin story,
the origin story is where Bob comes across Wilford Brimley
in like a cave somewhere,
training and medicating with the diabetes powers
and he passes it along to the new generation.
Wilford taught him everything he needs to know.
We'll listen tomorrow.
As always, thanks for the content.
Makes working out in the cold a little bit easier.
Also, for Anna, the warriors suck.
Oh my.
Oh my goodness.
The warriors?
Are they like a sports bowl team?
I don't know.
Or is that a TV show?
I feel like it's a TV show.
Yeah, maybe it's a TV show.
A booby?
How could I possibly know the outside of us?
Really suck.
Well, yeah, I mean, you know,
would a super chat lie?
I don't think so.
It sounds like the plot of Dracula Untold.
Oh no.
How dare you, Dracula Untold is a fucking masterpiece.
A masterpiece of cinema.
Movie Bob records.
A lot of proofs of its themes.
Movie Bob records the way he does
because it just takes whatever half sentences sound fine
and snap to previous everything.
He can get back to editing in two hours.
Oh, it's the laziest form of audio editing you do.
Yeah, if you notice as well,
he cuts himself off too early a lot of the time
on his videos, his sentences, like the words,
like say, for example, that the word words,
you have that like, right at the end, he'll cut the-
Cut it off in the S, in the S.
And he wouldn't fade it or anything.
So just cut, and you're just like, oh.
Because they're just rough cuts.
I've always kind of been an advocate of people on YouTube,
really everywhere, just kind of talking
like they talk normally.
Take out the pauses and the stutters
and misspeaks like that, but in terms of your cadence
and the way that you speak and the pacing,
that sort of thing, just talk like you normally talk,
putting on fake voices or trying to artificially speed it up
or edit it to where you're cutting yourself off.
Don't cut yourself off.
That's dumb.
Don't edit, don't go through extra trouble
to cut off yourself.
They'll probably say like, it's my style.
You'd be like, stop it.
Your style ain't shit.
Well, stop.
I just agree with your style.
But if I slowed down, they could understand
what I'm trying to say.
Well, we can't have that because then we would actually
be able to understand what he's saying
and then we might have to respond.
Can't have that.
People are listening, not watching or paying attention.
Good enough.
Robot had put out tweets about that hair drying robot,
the one that's got a hair dryer face, whatever.
He's like, good luck becoming popular
with baby Yoda around.
Yeah, that's very true.
Anyway, I believe the condition movie blob
has is called diarrhea of the mouth.
Also high bags and wall off.
Hello.
Wall off would say hi.
J fucking long bone.
She's got very funny videos.
This is true.
Yeah, she does.
Check them out.
It's great, it's fantastic.
Diabeto's one weakness is insulin.
Yes, as the meme pointed out.
Doctor, I forget what it was called.
The one that rags didn't laugh at.
Doctor?
Yeah, it was the insulin meme.
No, doctor and.
And so, and yeah, and ceiling or something.
Well, finally, find me a pack of degenerates
and send them all to my rooftops,
because it's EFAP time.
Glad this will keep me up all night
and turn my sleep cycle nocturnal again.
The other way around just doesn't suit me.
Apparently, razz nocturnal.
Why would a sun god be nocturnal?
I was about to say.
It's sun for the people on the other side of the planet.
Does, oh, okay.
Why wouldn't he be nocturnal?
Why would he sleep?
Well, while the sun's gone,
I mean, you might as well sleep.
I mean, the sun's up, you got stuff to do.
You're the sun god, but if the sun's away,
you're sleeping, you're resting.
And when you get up, you'll bring it back again.
You know what nocturnal means, right?
It's the opposite of that.
Say what?
What are we talking about?
If razz nocturnal, he doesn't sleep at night.
He's awake at night if he's nocturnal.
The sun's all, it's gonna be up on the other side.
It's up on the planet.
So he's sort of nocturnal,
because it might be dark for them, but for us,
hey, we got sun.
They got sun, we got sun, you know?
I completely agree.
The logistics of that are a little itchy.
It's between us and the sun, that's the issue.
Yeah, but when he says he's gonna be nocturnal,
that means he's gonna be awake during the dark,
which means he's not going to be on the other side
of the planet where the sun is.
His.
But who's dark?
His, his dark.
His dark.
Is he sleeping during his dark?
That's fine.
He's not though.
No, but he's gonna be awake.
Well, he's got shit to do.
He's got a sun sun.
Yeah, but as a sun god.
Drive across the sky.
Right, so you're not making sense.
Yeah, but.
No, I am.
No, fuck you.
No, fuck you.
I am making sense.
No, I'm making sense.
We'll leave it to chat to vote.
Did rags make sense?
One for yes, two for no.
Obviously, one is the number of the count,
and the number of the count shall be one.
I feel like we need to bookmark straw poll.
Bookmark straw poll.
I feel like it'll be a landslide.
All decisions will be settled by popularity.
Absolutely.
And the stars are like suns.
So now what?
Can't see all the other suns if the big sun's out.
I don't think that's how that works.
You're a god.
You think sun god's gonna be blinded or hindered
by his own son, preposterous.
Are you saying his son can't blind a sun god?
Is that shitty of a son?
No.
I'm saying he's better than his own creation.
I'm seeing.
It can't blind him.
In way more twos than ones.
It's almost explicitly ones.
It's actually almost all ones.
Does that mean we're out of it?
In fact, I haven't seen a two yet.
The twos have it.
Very interesting.
The twos definitely don't.
I haven't even seen a two yet.
This makes total sense if you remember
that the sun god, right?
He's gotta be, he needs to sleep
while the sun's somewhere else.
Sun doesn't go away.
Doesn't disappear.
Tell us something.
You're a strange man, right?
Then he wouldn't.
Oh man.
Man's gotta sleep.
Oh, this is an interesting one for me to read out.
My name is Mauler and I love TLJ.
The themes are great and I really enjoyed
what they did too.
Luke's character.
Don't listen to me if I say otherwise.
Hmm.
Amen.
Don't know what that means.
Anyway, hey, I'm a long time viewing before eFap started.
Seeing all the memes grow and stuff has been great.
Thanks for offering hours of distractions
from my horrible self doubt and loneliness.
Oh.
Oh, happy to do that for you.
I'm glad you enjoy the memes.
Yeah, the memes are really great.
We have the best memes though.
We only facilitate the memes.
Pop memes.
We don't like create the memes.
Yeah.
We kickstart memes.
We just provide the clowning
and then they provide the talent.
Wolf, you're working on writing a new book, right?
Good luck, my dude.
I'm writing my Facebook and it's been such a journey.
Also, Hi Rags.
Hello.
He is working on his new book.
Yeah, he's working away on it.
And he's also working on YouTube videos
as far as I'm away.
Cool.
So when you make it sound like he's written books before.
Yes, he did.
Iridescent was his first book, I believe.
I didn't know that.
That's cool.
It is no longer perchaseable,
but it did exist at one point.
Hmm.
The law of Yuki had a fat boy with the power
to change sugar into electricity.
Oh.
We have a new, we have a new diabetes based economy.
Yeah.
I mean, people in champion like,
you're like nine hours behind on super chats.
Guys, I'm aware of this.
What do you want me to do?
Nine hours?
Well, I mean, they're being hyperbolic
because this stream just hit nine hours.
So it's pretty impossible for that to be the case,
but you know, it's fine.
It's fine.
We're doing what we can.
Is insulin Diabeto's kryptonite?
Yes.
There's some, not even.
No, get it away.
This is why we don't get all the videos
except every Ted Buds.
No, it's not.
More stuff on the way.
Okay.
I used to watch movie Bob,
but the constant virtue signaling
combined with pretentious rambling wore me down.
What exactly was the appeal?
That's it.
Like what was the part that was like, well, there's this,
you know?
Well, I'll hang around for some reason.
Yeah.
Well, he's talking like this is something.
Like I remember him being pretty awful early on.
He didn't do the virtue signaling quite as bad,
but his takes were really terrible.
There was like, he was talking about one movie
and saying how it was totally fine because it was camp,
even though the whole thing was garbage.
And then another movie, he said it was garbage
and he didn't use the camp excuse.
And it's kind of seemed like he was favoring one movie genre
and giving it the gift of the camp tag
to completely dismiss how terrible it was.
Wait a minute, are you saying that he was inconsistent?
I think I am.
Was he handing out the camp tag?
Like people hand out theme tags?
Oh my God.
Kind of, yeah.
Yeah, he kind of seemed like it.
But then the virtue signaling happened
and it just got worse.
Oh no.
Yeah.
Isn't it crazy that you were on our stream
with Onision last year?
That is crazy.
Oh yeah.
That is crazy.
Didn't you like totally dig into Onision
while you were in there, right?
Rags did, yeah.
Yeah.
He's a piece of shit and you just took the opportunity.
You also didn't let the opportunity go down
to dig into Monday bat too.
You wouldn't let anyone get away with anything.
No, that chick was there.
Is that chick?
No, but he's nice.
It's like, what the fuck do you mean?
Oh, Monday man, he's nice.
Like, no, he actually kind of sounds like a prick.
He's well, what he did wasn't very nice.
I think we can all agree on that.
What he did was a terrible thing.
Let's see how, let's check out his YouTube channel.
See how he's, see how he's doing.
Yeah.
It's legit.
Raw.
It can't be nine hours.
I started streaming nine hours and three minutes ago.
And I've already read like a lot of Efap 61 chats.
It can't be nine hours ago.
It might be like the best it'll ever be
is like eight and a half or something,
but it can't be nine.
Do you have a ballpark for what we have left?
Do you really want to know?
So it says here that Matt Jarbo's last video, two days ago,
Death Stranding should be disqualified from,
the game awards.
What?
Okay.
Why?
Is it because it came out too late?
He says, let's see.
I take ethical issues with just how many nominations
Hideo Kojima's Death Stranding has received.
Let's see.
Joff Kaley, and now who announced the nominees
and Kojima have been BFFs for years.
And while Joff claims, he says,
he has no say in the nomination process.
The advisory board picks the gaming journalist outlets
that will choose which games get nominated.
It feels like a massive conflict of interest
and one that would have been a high profile controversy
during the height of gamer gate 2014.
So yeah, Matt thinks that Death Stranding
should be disqualified from the game awards.
It should not be able to win anything, I guess.
And he's basing this off of like influencers,
like maybe being biased or something?
Here's based on what I wrote out.
Yeah, so I don't know.
Oh my goodness, he talked about Donald Trump Jr.
floundering on the view.
That's a low score, even for Matt.
Two weeks ago, he did a orange man's son bad.
He sided with the view.
Well, then he made a-
You say low score, it says down bow tie?
Yeah, he's got two orange man bads in the last,
in his last little thing.
Wow, he's a, can't believe he's still doing this.
Ra is like, oh, it's 8.5 hours, not nine, oh, okay.
That's all I was trying to say.
You said it was nine hours when the stream
had only barely hit nine hours.
It's not physically possible, that's all I was trying to say.
I don't fucking know what specific time it is.
These aren't timestamped.
But yeah, you gotta remember, by the way,
there's more super chats at the beginning
than there are as the stream goes on, right?
So it's like, it's not like if it took half an hour
to read the first selection or whatever,
every selection runs that way.
You know, it's always different.
It takes you a different amount of times.
But we'll get there.
Diabito's parents died in the Jellicost.
Oh.
The Jellicost?
Yeah.
Took many lives.
Matt told us that his favorite Indiana Jones movie
is Temple of Doom, but his favorite movie
is The Last Crusade.
What?
His favorite movie is The Last Crusade,
but his favorite Indiana Jones movie is Temple of Doom.
That doesn't make any sense.
All right.
Interesting.
I'm sure he stopped that out very well.
Yeah.
Howdy, Muge Lord.
Hello.
Hi, Ragolds.
Hello.
Wolfsef.
I'm sure he would say hi.
I started reading the Witcher books,
but I'm kind of confused by the order.
Does The Last Wish come before Blood of Elves?
Molesboob, watch The Last Airbender.
I am set to do that.
It'll happen.
And as for the question about the Witcher books,
just Google it.
There's gotta be people who would answer that.
Like Wolf might be able to answer it,
but obviously he's not here.
But I don't know.
Google shall have the answer.
I do not know the answer to your question.
I'm sure somebody has said the same thing,
so you'll find it.
Did anyone say Catman yet?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
Catman?
Catman?
You Catman?
Have we seen Catman?
No, I have not.
Catman do?
Moles, I've been watching Buffy
and I gotta say it sucks
because Angel is clearly an Edward Cullen ripoff.
Fucking Angel was made before Twilight was written.
Also Zander is a lesbian.
But that's not possible.
There's restrictions in place that would prevent that.
No joke, he really did.
It's on the video.
Did you call Matt out on that?
Did you be like,
hey Matt, this doesn't quite make sense?
I don't know.
Yeah, like Matt.
I don't know, man.
Some here I heard right.
I feel like you don't know.
Two women on Efap?
Seems like I got some looking to do.
Yes, yes indeed.
Follow the teachings of Mr. Lee.
You guys should read Movie Bob's book,
it's a lot of things in episode.
Movie Bob has a book.
Oh, I almost forgot he does have a book.
Yeah, it was something about like being the best
at YouTube or some shit.
It was pretty bad.
Yeah, it was something about being a celebrity on YouTube,
something along those lines.
I don't have the exact title,
but that's what it was about in essence.
I have a free one, it's yours now.
Thank you.
I'm so glad I'm not the only one
who loves Scooby-Doo and Zombie Island,
loved that movie.
As far as I was aware,
a lot of people like Scooby-Doo and Zombie Island.
It's really good, it's my favorite of them all.
I remember being my favorite.
Billy destroyed him after he said that.
Yeah, that seems like it would make sense.
Poor Matt, poor Matt.
Let the rhino milk consume you, also high rags.
Okay.
Wonder if Movie Bob appreciates in his tweet
while he's a white dude talking about
how the future he is owed being stolen from him
and the class of people he holds responsible.
Horseshoe theory for the win.
I don't even, Movie Bob at this point,
I don't even know what specifically,
like politically, almost seems like he's in his own world.
A lot of the statements he makes,
like I just feel like the left would just be like,
dude, chill out.
We don't say that shit, okay.
Right.
Scooby-Doo and Zombie Island was what killed
the core premise of Scooby-Doo.
I'm not sure exactly what you mean by that.
Do you mean like it changed up the formula?
Yeah, say that one more time.
Scooby-Doo and Zombie Island was what killed
the core premise of Scooby-Doo.
Oh, I, okay.
Well, it made a new premise, that was amazing.
Maybe they're just referring to the fact
that the monsters were real.
I mean, is it the fact that it's like a different formula
in that, because it's like a movie, right?
Yeah, it was a movie, yeah, absolutely.
It was not like an episode, because I remember it,
I guess, yeah, it just, it changes up how Scooby-Doo works
as a formula, I guess.
Maybe what, maybe his takeaway is,
monsters are actually real, so they could be real later,
and that kind of bugs him.
Maybe, yeah.
I thought the whole point of Scooby-Doo is that,
all that people are the real monsters.
Yeah, and I think when they become actual zombies,
that they can't pull a mask off of.
But the zombies more like.
According to chat, there's earlier examples
of real monsters.
Yeah. Oh, in the show.
So maybe it was like the structure
of how the episode plays out.
I don't know, I really liked the Scooby-Doo
in Zombie Island, and I don't know about the,
I don't have too much care and investment
in the Scooby-Doo formula, you know?
Well then.
I thought it was great.
Also, Rags, love your TLJ review.
Oh, thank you.
When will TFA be done?
It will be done next week.
I thought it was August 2020 for the next part.
We talked it, yeah.
Oh, there you go.
A great Todd Phillips movie is due date
with Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis.
They go on a car trip across the country
to see Robert's kid's birth.
I've seen it, I found it pretty funny.
It's like having Tony Stark stuck in a buddy cop movie
with a fucking annoying idiot.
Oh, it sounds like a remake of Planes, Trains,
and Automobiles.
Kinda.
It's definitely its own thing.
It's just that I find it pretty amusing.
Yeah, I guess Todd Phillips made it, all right.
I haven't seen it in a while, though.
Also, thank you, DP.
I hated Scrappy as well.
Kill that little dog.
Just kill that little dog.
Peak meme hood, the Hex Girls are part of the lore.
Oh, we're just discussing the Hex Girls.
Oh, fuck sex girls.
So who, wait, who are the Hex Girls again?
Where are they from? Oh, God.
I was just asking. I explained it again.
Okay, that's fine. Aww.
Sorry, that's fine.
I don't actually care enough to put you through a list.
The Hex Girls are, okay, well, the Hex Girls,
they're a band of three young ladies
named Thorn, Dusk, and Luna,
and they appeared in Scooby-Doo and the Witches Ghost.
They're a band of the Hex Girls.
They're gonna put a spell on you.
Gotcha, because I heard somebody asking
who, which one you'd bang,
and I'm like, I don't even know these people.
Thorn.
Thorn is the correct answer.
Thorn is the correct answer.
Was that the guy with the black hair?
Yes.
Okay.
Is Rags eFap Scooby-Doo?
Right, oh, no.
Oh, well, there you go.
That is dead. I don't think I can eat that much.
All right, good dog, yeah.
Get some of your, get some of the devil's lettuce in you.
Get that racially charged.
Oh, yes, you're the, you're the, you're the dog.
I guess you're Scooby-Doo, the group.
Boo Brothers is peak Scooby.
Rags, you are scrappy.
Oof.
Wait, what?
Currently Boo Brothers is peak Scooby,
and Rags is scrappy.
I am not scrappy.
Take that back, you piece of shit.
It's the worst thing you can call the guy.
I was gonna say, that's quite a personal insult right there.
That goes right to the heart.
Yeah, how about you go turn around
and smoke that on the way to the bank.
Nailed it.
Off a short pier.
Yeah.
I remember the Scooby-Doo movie
where Shaggy turns into a werewolf
and he has to a Mad Max style race with other monsters
in order to turn normal.
That sounds like the plot of a Scooby-Doo movie.
Yeah, yeah.
You're like one of the old crazy ones.
Like the whole Scooby-Doo
where he has to take care of all the little monster babies.
He's like a teacher at a spooky school.
Oh, cool school, isn't it?
Cool school.
I think that's cool school.
I don't feel like Shaggy has like teaching credentials.
Well, that's because you're very racist
and you think white people can't teach.
Shaggy's white?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, let me look up Shaggy's last name.
By the way, do those fuckers live anywhere
or do they just live in the van?
I don't know.
Nobody knows.
Because it seems like they're always going somewhere
and then they stop at the mystery
on the way to wherever they're going.
Where are they going?
So the real name of Shaggy is Norville Rogers.
Oh.
Oh, Norville Rogers.
You guys remember Scooby-Dum?
Yes. No.
Also, the movie was Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf
for that one you were talking about, Rags?
The Reluctant Werewolf?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, apparently there's Scooby-D,
Scooby-Slide, who is a, it's Scooby-D
is Scooby-Doo's movie star cousin.
When Scooby-D was remaking a film,
maybe a long dead screen star, Milo Booth,
it seemed that Booth came back to life to put it into it.
It's a she, she's a movie star.
I remember this.
I like the Scooby-Pedia and it tells you
all about these characters.
Personality, Scooby-D is very sweet and kind.
And that's it.
Scooby-Pedia.
Scooby-Pedia.
Yeah, you gotta.
Look, if the fan base exists, they will do it.
No kidding.
There's a Scooby-Pedia.
Scooby-Pedia, that's amazing.
I'm glad the Scooby-Doo fan base have that.
We've been worshiping Ra and his rooftop all these months,
but we'll look really silly if this whole time
he's been living in a bungalow.
I mean, if you threw someone off a bungalow roof,
it would still hurt like hell.
Probably wouldn't kill him though.
Maybe that's the reveal.
Ra never wanted to kill anybody, just wanted to hurt them.
Send them a message, that sort of thing, mob style.
Even though they also kill people a lot.
But seriously, really enjoying it.
But given the amount of vampire attacks
and their lack of discretion,
the fact that all of Sunnydale is still oblivious
to the least believable thing about the show,
they do address that a couple of times.
The people are more aware than we think.
And the bigger question is why don't people,
why wouldn't the government stepped in?
But then that also gets an answer.
In fairness, there are addresses for that.
So they try.
The wheel building needs a lot of work in Buffy though.
If a male orphan has a child, thus gaining dad strength,
do they risk breaking their own bones
due to also having low bone density?
Oh my.
It's a tough question.
Dad strength, negative bone density, carry the one.
This isn't-
They have black hole bones.
I don't know if we have them.
I don't mean them black holes.
Well, I guess that wouldn't be negative density.
That would be like super density
would create an orphan black hole.
Jay Longbone is racist.
I convened with the council of color and they agree with me.
The council of color.
The council of color.
She would have appreciated that.
That's great, I'm borrowing that.
His origin story is that he went
to a candy named our sweets or sweets.
His parents fell deep because Friar
cause he bumped into them then developed his powers.
I think this is supposed to be about Diabeto.
So his origin story is that he went to a candy.
He went to a candy named our sweets.
I think that's supposed to be candy store.
His parents fell into, in the deep.
Just says in the deep cause Friar.
In the deep fat?
In the deep cause Friar.
Is that the deep fat Friar?
The deep cause?
C-U-Z, like as if to say because,
in the deep because Friar,
because he bumped into them then developed his powers.
So he accidentally pushed his parents
into the deep Friar for sweets and they died, I guess.
And then he became powerful.
I can believe that movie Bob accidentally bumped
into somebody else in a small confined space.
Yes.
I don't know why, I don't know what a deep fat Friar
was doing at a candy store.
I'm just curious how the death of his parents
provided him powers.
I don't see how that works.
Were they caramelized alive?
Deep Friar.
How does he gain the powers?
That's the really important element to this.
Like I don't understand.
This is just a tragedy.
Like how do we know how,
if you don't know how to gain the powers,
the story's worthless, I'm sorry.
It's just honesty.
I don't get it.
Yeah, I don't get it.
Love You Wolf, very kind.
This is the film that media outlets
were convincing people not to go to
for fear of getting shot.
Of course it's a bit impressive it succeeded.
Yeah.
I still think that it's absolutely reasonable
to be impressed that this film made over a billion dollars.
That's not easy for any film to do.
Yeah.
Any film making a billion dollars is impressive.
And I feel like he's fucking bitter about it.
He's like, it's a little impressive.
It is bitter.
It's a little impressive at all.
That's why I'm glad.
He's like, yeah, of course it was gonna make this movie.
It's just about this thing.
People would pay for it no matter what.
It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Be salty and bitter.
The high veto.
I've been foiled again by Joker.
Drat.
And then he like flies away.
What kind of saying is this?
What kind of saying is this?
This is the film that media outlets.
Oh wait, sorry.
Wolf, which hex would you bone?
Oh, did he answer that?
I think, yeah, he said thorn, right?
He said thorn.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's an easy one.
That's a softball.
Also float that one over towards you.
Check out Ford versus Ferrari.
I've built cars and motorbikes from my old man,
all my childhood.
And I thought it was based as hell.
Avoid the bitch boys.
Bitch boy takes from soy guys online
and why it's problematic though.
If I fucking, if they tell me that it's misogynist
because not enough women have speaking roles or some shit,
I'd be like, okay, all right.
Just tell us beforehand what percentage of the show
needs to have female speaking in the cast,
just so we know what, you know, poof.
Me, I think I have just enough time to clean my dorm,
finish my papers and go to bed at a reasonable time.
Oh, a new eFap, oh no.
Oh no.
You can do all those things while listening to eFap.
You'll be fine.
Just, you know, take a look at the screen
whenever movie Bob says something.
Yeah, this stream is great for when you're cleaning
your place, you kidding me?
Yeah.
Hooray.
Company.
Clean your room.
Hey guys.
Clean your basement apartment.
The likelihood is somebody's like doing some cleaning
right now while like, I don't know,
they're playing this on a TV or earbuds or something.
So we're like in their ear while they're cleaning.
How does it feel to clean?
Feel good?
Yeah.
Sweet, sweet, sweet.
Sweet that up.
Yeah, put it in the bin.
Oh, you're moving some stuff on the shelf, huh?
Yeah, I'm watching you.
Use the spot.

Now go back and get it.
Yeah, not the left, not another spot.
A little bit further.
Yep.
Yeah, I think you got it.

It's under there.
Smells like old Cheetos.
Oh no.

that yes movie bob i don't i was i don't oh i no idea she says movie bob rah we're gonna need a
stronger roof oh before rock and throw he just cracks through the roof and he's the rah's like
what the fuck is my house dude it's like dropping a metal rod from space it lands and just oh the
impact has a clue energy current scenario that's why movie bob whenever he wants he can end the
world if he just jumps up and down oh that kind of power oh my goodness knock us out of orbit kill

dooby doo i tell you dooby doo yeah uh fair warning then a lot of these won't make any sense
don't worry that's fine i'm gonna try to behave too we've got reams of behave what do you mean
this is the fact i don't know i'm trying to be a sweet boy okay i don't know we'll see um we just
got done talking about scooby jew and throwing people off of roofs scooby jew yeah commonly
known for roof throwing you're like i don't remember that yay at least we're known for something
all i had to do on the internet was admit once that my dna test showed one percent jew and now
everyone has pasted a luchador mask over all of these uh weird holocaust propaganda photos
well you know sometimes you walk yourself into these things i guess
uh anyway i wouldn't be surprised if movie bob was a closet nazi that man should never be under
any circumstances get any political power i yes agreed but i don't think he would agree we should
be fine on that regard uh scooby doo and the angry jew let's see who this ghost really is
old man goldstein
good job for finding out who the monster was how for that we're going to give you a few scooby
shackles old man goldstein the guy who runs the local pawn shop i knew it was you you best
i would have gotten away with it too weren't we a dumb dog you like a hot dumb dog you dumb dog
i can't believe this you guys think of that i ever got to scooby after all those episodes
being called a dumb dog you think he was ever like okay enough in you ever snapped and just
ripped someone's throat out could you imagine what it was like being compared to marmaduke
for your entire career oh yeah rough eventually just loses the speech impediment talk some serious
shit um if scooby was racist would he hate riggers oh so riggers are like people who rig things up
you know like sound systems exactly yeah lighting fixtures you know really but seriously like scooby
is to marmaduke what heathcliff is to garfield well heathcliff um yeah wasn't heathcliff practically
just a scrappy dude that actually did beat up things no no heathcliff was garfield only with
a slightly different personality an orange cat that was fat um well sure in the looks department
oh i see i see this here um it only ran for about a year
i mean like he he was he was like smarmy like garfield but then he like always beat everything
up i don't know yeah heathcliff was like uh i guess a homeless cat when garfield wasn't
that was like the main difference no this he wasn't part of the the um
oh the the catalact cats that is different right yeah that was the that was the junkyard
cats that lived in the same universe as heathcliff why the fuck are they drawing these cats so sexy
no seriously one of the catalact cats is like supposed is drawn like supposed to be like really
hot for a cat okay i'll never forget this we we had adam from your movie sucks on dp one time
and he was telling me he was he liked he likes cat men so i was showing him thunder cats and i'm
like which thunder cat are you most attracted to it that was kind of difficult did he have an answer
oh my jesus christ not not really i guess panthro panthro i guess technically yeah i mean you know
making it making the choice that's what you got to do everyone's like uh rags like no it doesn't
look good show cats is clearly supposed to be a sexy cat proto fairy i'm just describing what
the show is portraying you disturbed all of chat rags well done good why i didn't i didn't draw it
i'll never forget the first episode of thunder cats because they're all naked
have you guys ever seen did you guys remember the first thunder cats episode maybe not
i don't think i never watched that i i i was aware of it but i never watched it
i can't type in thunder cats naked because i know you know they were all anthropomorphic
people cats but more towards the human side but in the first episode they're all nude
they they don't realize that yeah belts and shoes wow the kids yeah yeah right there there you go
yeah chitaro uh nipple-ist uh uh chitaro with no nipples
that must be the peeps that must have been weird drawn yeah weird drawn i think it was anime uh
animator it's the same animation team that did thunder cats or uh silver hawks rather silver
hawks silver i mean they're wearing belts that counts as clothes it's fine they got
no those are accessories so how did we wind up here anyway rags are talking on sexy cats
no one of the one of the Cadillac cats his name is Cleo as i've discovered
need to watch so we clearly drawn to be a sexy cat and i just pointed this out because it's
odd so apparently it makes me a bad person there you go chat it was all to rags okay
okay yeah i just it's impossible to not notice go to google uh google Cadillac cats
right and then you'll be like oh obviously i know exactly which one he's referring to
so we've we've gone from Scooby-Doo to Heathcliff to sexy cats and all the way back to reluctant
werewolf is the best Scooby-Doo film all right i love how someone found the photo of the naked cats
and and they are all totally naked yeah they're just saying that i don't it's it's weird it is very
strange because like it like if they if they ever want to like fuck or jerk off or something like
that like what where does it just like spring out or like in between i where what's going on rags
needs to know the answers to these questions okay this is some deep lore we're diving into here
thanks rags i got a virus now there's something wrong with the Cadillac
uh you can't trick me into fairy sexy doggo
i'm not
everyone's like oh you said that's like no look at it like look at the hips man
that was yeah here if you go look at the the picture of the the Cadillac cats
this picture is actually a picture of a picture very strange you got one two three four five six
seven there's seven cats i'll tell you what the leg warmers do it for me the leg just the leg oh
yeah she's like Olivia Newton-John basically oh yeah let's get physical that Xanadu looking sort of
like what are you wear clothes no just leg warmers just just enough clothes to acknowledge
the rest of me is naked it's cool i got hair all over my chest all right yeah you know everybody
because she's wearing clothes in this one she's got this big pink coat and gloves she's got leg
warmers on of course uh-huh leg warmers are still canon this is strange and again i didn't make it
i'm just pointing out that it's weird all right i'm sure you've justified yourself to chat at
this point i'm sure they don't think any lesser or anything of you i'm sure no one thinks any
lesser of me for pointing this out uh thoughts on kk being kath and kennedy saying that the
sequels were hard to make because she had no source material expanded universe rules in its
grave thanks for making life great guys have a good fab thank you very much and yeah we covered
this a few times now but uh really dumb and just because you have no source material doesn't mean
you can't fucking continue a story holy shit i thought that's the whole reason you hire these
writers for millions of dollars because they know how to fucking write was that the woman
and fan base that you guys pissed off is that what that was no kathie kennedy is the like
ceo of lucas film right now i think um okay they're talking about like how she's recently said that
you know marvel has it easier because they have source material to work from when that's disney
fucking nuked the extended universe or expanded universe so it's just like how can you fucking
say that what the hell um and then it also implies that like a lot of the films in the
marvel universe like go off script completely like you might be like oh but they still have
time to work from it's fucking they practically made their own films and you know a lot of people
take issue with that like some of the films take the names of some kind of comic story but then
they alter it completely um right i'm just waiting for the natalie portman thor film right yeah
that's because you know that's gonna be natalie thorman natalie thorman scooby doo meets the jew
brothers oh no scooby jew but hitler love dogs um oh that's i'm surprised you were allowed to
say hitler in a super chat i would thought they'd prevent that oh my goodness wow yeah he got away
with that thanks thanks google for letting people reference historical figures how about how about
scooby doo meets harvey weinstein and jeffrey eppstein i mean i think it can work scooby doo and
pedophile island they would have gotten away for it take him down they could have if it weren't for
them sneaking kids yeah i mean there's lots of stories to go i think it'll be a whole season's
worth of stories here um uh and i would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for you
meddling yids oh i get it i get that star wars jab and jay long jab i feel like that joke was
already made all right and then what's gonna get them jab versions out there um scooby doo in the
jew school i don't know if i saw that one scooby doo in the syrian invaders
a weekly what is this last sorry what was this last picture that you what was the last picture
rags posted oh it's because it was just one of the images where she was just getting like
and getting someone but it's from the show it gets weird like the people who made this were
clearly like guys i gotta draw these ugly characters but cleo oh man oh man i have to
do anything i want get her man handled it's hot when she gets kidnapped
a weekday epheb what madness is this long man how shall your audience sleep now
he'll find a way uh when that you'll be able to sleep in three hours yeah yeah we've got um
exactly two hours and 12 minutes we probably will not beat all the super chats by then but we
should get pretty close go go when that cold bob hits i think it's rich the movie bob thinks he's
some sort of uber mensch when he looks like he's been thrown into a gas chamber oh uber mensch
he looks like he's a he looks like he is kind of a balloon person like if you poked him he would
he would go and he'd start flying around the room i mean we did we did say diabeto could fly so
he's the uber mensch he lets air out
off he goes uh so rag i'm gonna read this and well i just i'm gonna read i'm gonna read it as
it said rags all right do you suck toes because i've got 10 little piggies that could use some
mouth hugs oh my goodness no i don't suck toes i'm so sorry super chatter elite ass man but i
i ain't gonna put my mouth on toes draw the line i gotta draw the line somewhere
oh the next one just says hi rags hello hello hello have you ever gone in to eat the ass
and then like the smell deters you like welcome back and then you like did like a loop de loop
and came back around fucking joints did you say that like
that wasn't really really anything generally it's just like a drag over the top you know
the pure typing because you want to kind of get them in the shower so you could sort of
and uh interesting conversation yep
up don't worry me and both terrified too
statement here uh it's better you have better luck eating out guys than gals is that effect
yeah because at least in my experience right you have a guy over you're with you're with
you're with a dude right you know what's going on back there and you you've prepared you know
you know what's going on back there right you're someone's ass is getting uh it's gonna be you gotta
be part of the action right so they know to make sure it's all nice and looking good and
you know you know prim and proper right you know they they know they know
oh that's it oh i can finally sleep tonight oh it's because uh it's because there's no other
alternatives so they got to make sure it works right well yeah i mean you know it's like you
know someone's getting fucked in the ass right and so you want it to you know is cool prep
involves you know what looking good and everything so you get down there and you're like man this is
this is looking all right you've been doing some work all right i can see the logic welcome back
star wars girl welcome you're talking about catalog cats all right well i asked the best
question at the best possible moment oh i did not think i was going to walk into this conversation
so when i first came in here i'm like i i have to watch what i say here and mauler's like you're on
efap i'm like all right let's go let's go all the way then you know we mentioned at the beginning
that this is not a kid friendly stream no it's really oh did you mark that oh he's totally
marked that kids shouldn't be fucking watching this shit you kidding me no no they should go
watch lord genesis instead yes uh then then then run away in fear but you know any choices he's
become oh my god oh his dad got interviewed the other night but yeah by police really no no by
by a live streamer his dad answered a random call from a live streamer and talked about a lot
of stuff oh my i i don't know why but his dad seems like a pretty reasonable still an enabler
but uh pretty reasonable uh kind of guy oh i'm sure he's probably someone who's like doing
everything held hostage in the house yeah i mean seeing as how senior genesis turned out i kind of
imagine he's an enabler maybe jared cast a spell you don't know what his power is you know what he
could do he's a real man uh so this just says high wolf uwu and then the next one says scooby
juby jew where are you oh no you're in that part of the super chat i've been gone for hours yeah i
know you know how long this takes i know it describes that as a shindler's list sequel
oh no i don't i don't think so i don't think there's less the musical i don't know if spiel
big will be on board but maybe producing i don't know uh he'd still be wrong because you talked
scooby doo i'm not sure that's referencing uh we got the good j on for once also hi that
star wars girl i forget her name it's anna she didn't say hi back damn yeah it's a shame
sea rags you've created an expectation now where people think they're gonna get a high back but you
know sometimes it's not the case sometimes it's not the case uh juby doo scooby doo meets
juman and robin all right if you know what that wasn't even clever you just said you instead of
bat i don't know man all right wouldn't it have been funnier to swap out bads it was bat jew
i don't know that'd be better just saying her standards are sinking here if an orphan eats
alone is it a family meal uh depends on the definition from the piston providing the meal
like if you know you know family if it means like everyone who's related to you in blood and there's
just you but like most people don't go by any kind of definition like that it's usually like
yeah but if i if i go to bed right it's not like all the family's taking a nap she's had it well i
mean if you're the only one of your family left maybe it is because they're with you in spirit
and they go to sleep with you you know i'm not ray not all the spirits of the the jedi before
me are gonna be there to sleep with me or whatever you don't know that i have no idea i don't even
know i don't even know what the rules are anymore i don't know that the rules are that there are no
rules that's the big rule clearly we've got fusion now um cancel culture is the inevitable
end point of letting holes have a voice in society facts thanks raw yeah raw with the takes uh scooby
doo and the jew invaders all right that's just a variation of the other one you did i i see right
through you here's my free super chat money thank you very much also an efap with wolf and jay
longbone and anna and special guest rags what a wonderful surprise this is i know oh my goodness
very special guest yeah when we started that up nine and nine ten hours ago you know that was an
interesting stream that that was scooby jew and the cyber jew or scooby doo in the cyber jew sorry i
didn't want to misrepresent that scooby doo in the cyber jew mhmm michael moor is a fat traitor
and that is a quote from diabeto
was um was moob like giving michael more shit for liking joker
uh he gave him shit for saying it was the thing about columbine i forget the specifics
um scooby doo and the curse of the 13th jew i don't know why the 13th one cast a spell but
everyone knows there used to use the unlucky one oh there was a uh there was a scooby doo
halloween special when i was a kid called the 13 ghosts of scooby doo back in the day
that might be worth a referencing maybe yep uh which show is crazier anna efap or the jack show
um probably the jack show yeah we're pretty tame here everything's mostly normal
aside we don't talk about anything weird yeah it's a pretty normal conversation
everyone talks about that every day all the time it's fine you guys have yet to talk about cancer
babies on efap so i guess that's right cancer babies well give it we haven't we had an aids
bus does that come close the aids bus hit the orphans or something and they created cancer babies
it's a simple formula at least your parents didn't have to watch you die young of cancer
oh no no cancer baby lived it's a it's a thing actually okay okay all right um that's cool happy
endings don't forget about scooby dolby dumb he's the best scooby dolby dumb yeah i do they just
mean scooby dumb there was a scooby dumb yeah i don't know i don't know scooby dumb his middle name
i don't know that much of the lore you know they were getting me uh to the worst fallen order jedi
i have seen but still love your content no more gay jacking with jay oh they're talking
about my stream in fairness i was on the hardest difficulty i never played it before but i was
pretty bad i'll give it to you i was pretty bad no more gay jacking with jay i don't know i didn't
know i was gay that's where do you have cameras that's screwed up shouldn't be shouldn't be
shouldn't be commenting on such things um are they referring to the twam stream
um i don't know star wars girl i heard you lack knowledge of the eu and i want to help
eu stands for european union star wars was filmed there it's embarrassing not to know this but you
know life saved i did know it was filmed there oh hold on hold on tun is tunisia in the european
union i think they're talking about the new films how they were filmed in like ireland and stuff
oh but i did know that and i do know about the expanded universe so uh i don't think i'm lacking
too much knowledge on it the only thing i'm lacking knowledge in is stuff about revin but
that's because i was told not to read the books because apparently the books are shit
and to play the game but i am notoriously awful at playing video games so uh yeah
yeah right then uh people like barber why kids like me got bullied worse after columbine tubby
forgets people got typecasted as school shooters over media um yeah i wouldn't know i don't know
if that actually oh they're probably nazis it's fine oh okay well what did he what do you call it
the natural selection of intelligence something like intellectual fitness i don't even know what
he means exactly by that like how does someone get knocked out of the gene pool through unintelligence
like in our society that's not a thing is it outside of if they accidentally kill themselves
which is not going to happen i don't think not for the amount that he wants like the stupid people
all kill themselves accidentally i like the idea that he says that we're just like this is mysterious
all of them have been shot in the back of the head he's like yep it's weird they're dumb they're
really you know those stupid those dumb people now it's just up to us smarts don't hurt i mean
everybody would easily elect him as president he knows what's up he knows what he's doing
and bob we trust is a thing that he actually has on his videos oh that's right he does he does have
the i am god no i'm good yeah but god doesn't have to catch his breath every time he says it
okay this is how it's spelled guys uia wise it isn't sunday white also high uwu wags hello
if the reason for a shooting was breathing oxygen would they say breathing is bad
breathing is bad breathing is nazis breathe hitler did it yeah hitler drink water yeah
there's proof there's a video where he breathes i've seen it fucking got him the darwin awards
are a thing a hilarious and tragic thing yeah i know but you never get so what he's after is like
knocking out this enormous portion of like the american population and he's like ha ha
intellectual natural selection it's like i don't think i don't most people don't accidentally
kill themselves regularly like you don't know yeah most people aren't so dumb they kill themselves
accidentally sneaky effab what the fuck also hey jay long bone your hair has been on fire recently
it's very true friendly reminder death to the aliens hashtag humanity first hashtag human
supremacy oh my goodness i wanted to ask you guys something uh now that i have you all here have you
have you read the timothy zon uh star wars novels yes okay like that for me was the continuation
after the original trilogy did you read the kind of wish i'm i'm not familiar with that no i'm not
no i i read like dark force rising and like the trilogy that came after that okay so yeah yeah you
should read the duology i actually think it's better than the trilogy it takes place 10 years
after the trilogy came out it's really good it's called the hand of throng duology
did you ever read the the one where luke finds the glove of darth vader and it like
uh i i read like you know because there was such a there was such a void of star wars content
forever between the original you know between the early 80s and the uh the prequels that there was
so much fiction being written at the time and i don't think they cared anything about continuity
at all with it they were just kind of like whipping it out so there were so many series
of novels that are now erased uh simply by disney acquiring the star wars property
it's insulting to everyone that put all that time in and i think one of the great things is um
that timothy zon did because there was a series that came out in between well there's a few of
them that came out in between his
i uh oh i think she just went back is she gone oh oh no am i tweaking out again
yeah yeah we lost you my internet is shit but uh yeah well what did you trouble earlier
uh you just cut off mid sentence what was the last thing i said
um were you even listening sir about the timothy zon and then like that was lost
oh uh he actually took the time to read the books that came out in between uh when he wrote the
trilogy and the duology so he adds in characters and he explains things that people freaked out
about because somebody wrote this stupid trilogy which i mean some people like it i'm not the
biggest fan of it i don't think it was that great but it's where luke is training jedi and they're
on you know the base in yavin and one of his students you know gets this dark side inkling
so to understand him and to relate to him luke taps into that dark side power and people lost
their minds like luke is going to the dark side it's like no he just tried it to relate to this
student to make sure that this student wouldn't go to the dark side and it backfired all these
people died but um no you're right that is the equivalent of that you're right well but he added
it in and he answered all the questions and he fixed it so i was like he did such a good job
they should just have him write the movies but yeah well yeah yeah okay fine they erased you know
the eu but look where we go in return such great films if you directed a series of movies
and there was a scene in the second movie where one of the one of the characters got
sucked out into the vacuum of space and at that point the actor was already literally dead
and why would you not kill them like we were all understood yeah like yeah i think i think
that we would all come to but it would have been fucking shocking to be like that's she's dead wow
yeah i was like finally i was like i was like all right they're gonna honor her this way they
kill her off like whatever and then they brought her back in i'm like wait you killed harrison
ford already you've killed all these people that are still alive yeah one the one original star
wars actress that's gone is the one you have in the yeah like what well we've gotta have we gotta
have leia live and be amazing and incredible fuck everyone else well she's the only like original
series character they can't ruin no unfortunately she's the only one who died the fucking i'm pretty
sure red light media make that comment it's like such a fucking tragedy she's the only one who
is left technically unruined and she could fucking die if they can't ruin it's because
they protected her too much she was like too protected i mean forget the fact she kissed
her brother right but you know outside of there i mean the silence right
i thought everyone kissed their brother what not everyone knows who my brother is everyone settled
down all right please i don't know well i mean well have you ever heard of have you ever heard
of dianor before are you familiar with dianor i am dianor are you one of the Cadillac cats
no i feel like i'm the one who will get dianor dianor yeah yeah dianor
have you got a picture on hand you can show him bed
do you okay mauler you you know who dianor is right yeah but okay should we show them the picture
what i yeah well yeah i won't show um hold on oh my god this design stole uh sold and i can prove it
this design sold five thousand t-shirts i believe that okay now all right
you should give them give them the lore of how it happened
okay i want to see a picture of this t-shirt first where is it dianor there's a popular character
popular character on my show named jim ass who was totally not someone i know who's not
jim ass yeah jim ass okay
i like how you're like yeah jim ass yeah i'll tell you what i'll tell you what jim
ass was so notorious and his personality was so well loved and prolific that even till this day
people think that uh mr medicare is secretly jim ass but he's not well now you just spoiled it
no i didn't well all right there you go i posted it so i want to i want to let you all know
this design i and this is not a joke we sold five thousand t-shirts oh my god design on it oh is that
a rim grant yeah let me get that onto the screen for the a lot of people in this channel probably
know it if they've washed drunken peasants some of them might like i'm not even gonna lie i think
i would probably
dino dino drog door blarg it's um what can we really say it's wonderful
yeah thank you jim ass i like how the dino looks like he's got a poop on deck
that's uh about to explode dinosaurs crowning is that what you're saying
he's horribly constipated oh my goodness he has to well he has to take a fucking dinosaur size
you know you know those massive piles from Jurassic Park actually uh uh the hilarious
thing is teespring thought a little kid drew that and featured it on all their social media
and they're like oh isn't this cute it's like oh yeah this is totally taking a great big number
to nor to nor that's the meteor that hit the earth yes anyway uh so yeah this is just the next
super chat i read like there's no you know i'm just gonna people are born nazis oh that's uh
that's what it says oh okay and it says this i don't know about that but well it's a quote you
see yeah that's me and it's a quote from cinema Roberto i just can't quote from it did he really
say that that's the thing i can't tell what's a parody yeah i was gonna say i can't fucking confirm
that he might have he's pretty close i guess for anna and for ben we're gonna play a game on a
future efap called like who said it movie bob or hitler and it's a bunch of quotes and we have to
decide whether or not movie bob or hitler said well we have to have wolf on for that as well
it'll be funny it'll be great oh for sure for sure so here's the thing though if he says nazis
are born does that mean being a nazi is not a choice and he shouldn't discriminate you shouldn't
discriminate against him if it's not their choice yeah yeah careful bob uh-oh spaghetti oh movie
bob yeah oh no it sounds pretty bigoted oh no oh no well why movie bob why i'd kill to know
how cinema roberto got his views he was there in the beginning that's all the explanation i've
yeah i think that's about right he it was around for pretty much everyone else he was one of the
old school guys he got in earth and he just kept on making like he must have he must have made a
staggering amount of videos by now well he used to do like big animations and shit like with like
the overthinker and the the stuff like that yeah he's like a bunch of cream screen yeah i remember
people saying costumes and greens the videos where he's like really that bad or really that good i
remember people saying that those are better from him but um it wasn't his take still bad regardless
i'm pretty sure they were probably i mean he was one of the people who came to the day you know
he one of his big things that kind of you know he was one of those pro anita sarkisian people
and he was anti-gamer gate and anita didn't do nothing and she's you know an angel and just a
bunch of angry white men don't like women in their video game she's a fucking idiot
it's definitely been impressing people on twitter lately oh yes big big impress
um do do don't you guys know talking is basically murder so all of you saying not all nazis are
columbine shooters is wrong also nazis is banned yeah that makes sense nazis is banned declare
i got away with it he said nazis is bad sad face he said to clarify i'm sad about the censorship
only he's like i'm not sad about the lack of nazis or anything you know it's just fine
anita sarkisian and donald trump actually agree that video games cause violence but anita would
never admit it that's good no you had to mention her name i know it's well you have to say it three
times for anything to happen right well she accused me of raping her just because i took a
photo what oh oh wait okay okay starting five five years ago i was in a tabletop gaming place
in columbus ohio and i'm just playing my game with my friends there what game was it and then i
i don't even remember now you're in the patriarchy yeah i forget things well what you know uh i think
it might have been stratego uh stratego um or crossbows and catapults if you're familiar with
that that was another one i played there now i haven't heard of it um so i'm playing my game
i look up the door opens who walks in literally anita sarkisian she walks in she walks down the
stairs and sits behind me and i'm like no one is gonna believe that anita sarkisian came in here
and sat behind me yeah so so i took a picture of her over my shoulder why didn't you just ask
to take a selfie with her well that's what that's what uh boogie did did she know who you were
i don't know she wouldn't have known um but why didn't you just ask her hey can i take a selfie
with you she would say yes that's her giving you consent and then you post it because she's
gonna probably freak out or we'll say selfies are yeah she had like an entourage because she if you
know if you say oh my gosh anita sarkisian my friends aren't gonna believe that you know i met
you can i take a selfie with you maybe she would 100 say yes if she's got her little entourage she
would feel super special about it and then when you post it and she loses her fucking shit it's
like bitch you fucking smiled you said it would have been hilarious if you said i'm a part of this
part of this is like someone i was associated with at the time was
one of her least favorite people ever but on top of that well did you see that person
tell that person to go to the bathroom when there's no no and you know what i could have
i could have like been disingenuous and gotten her to take her picture taken with me sure um but
it's not disingenuous if you're literally gonna take a picture of her anyway and say hey like i
guess it depends on how you sell it if you're like i'm a fan of yours if you were like i don't like
you but i'd like to take a picture with you i can almost guarantee you she would have said no anyway
you just say hey nobody's gonna believe that i ran into you can i take a selfie with you
yeah like she's notorious for never addressing any criticism or doing any debates or doing any
conversations with people like the closest thing you're gonna get to anita sarkisian
like addressing her critics is when she called sargon a garbage human it's the closest you're
getting wasn't sargon in the chat earlier yes he was yeah he was he visits every now and again
he hasn't come on the show just yet he's floating around efap he's keeping an eye on us making sure
we're not too crazy he's been on tv a couple times too good guy good guy
how does he get his movie carl so anyway get back to how you raped a person
okay yeah um i'm i'm i i just found the photo oh my god it's been so long we're coming up on
the anniversary of this shit like yeah yes it's been a long um so i just posted it there there's
the photo of of me and my face and then anita sitting behind me but yeah she took that
and made it seem like i stalked her literally i was long way i was there before she showed up
and i left before she left so no stalking on my point on my part whatsoever
but then she got you this is a weird question to ask but which which piercing hurt more your
nose ring or your lip ring uh nose ring um it's almost like getting punched in the nose
hmm you know um it it breaks the tear line you have a line from the bottom of your mouth
all the way up like through between the center of your eyes where if you get hit hard enough there
you will cry huh so it's kind of like that but um the uh the tattoos on both of my arm like i
both of my arms totally covered and though those hurt way more than uh every any piercing piercings
like a lot of pain all at once and then it tapers out and like tattoos is like a little bit of pain
spread out over a really long time makes sense anyway so so she caught you taking that picture
then she didn't catch it no no no i i posted it on twitter actually actually when i saw anita show
up i went into the bathroom and called my friend tj and was like tj anita is here and you should
come down here and we can get like a photo of you like shaking her hand or whatever and he's like
nah fuck it i'm not coming down i'm like all right well no one's gonna believe we were here so i'm
just gonna take a quick photo of her took the photo left posted it on twitter and then like
hours later there was like a bunch of virtue signaling feminists uh accusing me of committing
a crime by taking a photo of a public figure in a public place ah yes yeah yeah you never know when
the internet's great i was gonna say we we just got done with our
version of that like not the same thing but similar the whole oh my goodness what's happening
well what's happening people are suddenly just lost rags and that's the whole skill
oh no and you know uh some of uh some of uh whoever that woman was and her fan base that
you pissed off i can't remember her name right now her fans came to the stream that you guys
ron with us and disparaged you yeah some of them a couple of them showed up and i'm like what
well like in the in the stream chat or the comments uh in in the in the comments after
the the episode you guys were on you were saying tj amazing atheist yes yes uh yes with amazing
atheists me and tj did drunken peasants for four years together so yeah um yeah like we we really
pissed off a lot of people you know what's funny though as you've been here for this long now
this is uh honestly absorbs probably the majority of that jenny stream what we're doing right now
and it's like not even to do with it and yet people will be like this discuss you talk about
it for that long it's like she's not that interesting trust me however scooby jew infinite
amount of time to talk about that oh yeah that's that's what i mean like what about scooby people
who are fans of scooby and the harlem globe trotters that was my favorite episode and batman
or robin those are my uh my favorites um yeah rags just said his internet is apparently down
right now i don't know if he's trying to get it back up but that was a weird coincidence
yeah no discord like tweaked out for a minute and i thought i saw everyone and it didn't say
that anything was disconnected i thought we were all just playing the silent game
and i was trying so hard not to mention i mentioned he who can't be named and the internet
went who who cannot be named i don't know obviously i don't know who you're talking about
if he says it again everything will go to shit i know that's did you did you notice like
literally the moment i yeah what if he types it in its even worse no just can you i get hints
no i don't get hints also i was gonna say no that it was just funny that people would like
say all their stuff about this this stream but then fans of it are just confused because of the
amount of stupid shit we talk about um and that's just sort of the funny conclusion um
we'd be really bad at our jobs if our goal was to just hate on women slash people of color slash
every kind of istant ism you can imagine just like man we're really inefficient too
it's like if that's all we did i'm pretty sure we would not last at all because that
like if we did that shit gets boring quick yes you gotta throw in some scooby-doo some
biggity is some singapore there's this clowns like there's a lot of really important details
into this mixture this recipe um yeah you know before uh before i was just gonna say quick right
this next super chat sums it up you got you gotta listen to this um who would you who would win in
a fight to the death a tiny gandalf with no magic but he has a dagger or tiny hitler but he tiny
hitler has no weapons but he's in his prime gandalf is four inches tall and tiny hitler is six inches
tall gandalf gandalf a four inch gandalf with no magic but he still has a dagger versus a hitler
without a dagger but he's in his prime and he's six inches hitler was not a combatant that's so
hard to answer gandalf is pretty old he has no magic no no and i'll tell you why i'll tell you
why it's hard to answer because gandalf in of himself is immortal right i don't yeah i don't
think a knife could kill him or could it wait immortal doesn't mean invincible then he's not
gandalf wait does it mean like we have to fight them in fantasy immortal doesn't mean unkillable
though it means you live forever without somebody can kill you but who are they fighting
well each other they're each other oh they're fighting each other oh gandalf will win gandalf
can outsmart gandalf would win because he'd all that smart hitler and gandalf has seen more battles
hitler's just some fucking barking dog in a uniform i mean gandalf has the knife too so
yeah exactly he may be shorter by two inches but he's got the weapon he's got the edge
yeah and that's the thing it's all like a lot a lot of people like to boast like it's not that hard
to do so i'm gonna go with your knife it's like no it fucking isn't a knife is really goddamn easy
to get cut by and you're gonna get fucked up and gandalf knows how to use it um god i'd say hitler
who's a front frontline soldier in world war one gandalf i don't know he got a lot of experience
there a lot of experience he's full some balrogs you know i'm just saying oh this is suitable as
well the next one says sargon's in the chat get him in now i like the idea that we read this
eight hours late i wonder if he's still there um clown man bad that's that's fair i sat through
classes at dartmouth a place that educates world leaders in which students and professors unironically
suggested that nazism is inherent to whites like genes that's when i knew i wanted to live in white
neighborhoods oh rah oh rah oh rah um i got a few of these free from youtube boys so here you go
split amongst y'all thank you very much yeah seriously though i'm excited to finally see you
on a regular efap anna and i'm glad you're on with the original three so now i'll say hi anna
and also hi rags uh thank you hi rags are you there
his face is there he came back yeah he came back
he never uh he never said anything maybe he like went to go fix his internet in some place and
it now is fixed and he's still not bad he's there i think the internet yeah he's there
hey there he is hello it went down for a wee bit down a little bit down yeah you missed the hitler
gandalf conversation oh no who won well you know what everyone keep keep your opinions to yourselves
all right that's really funny that you said that rags okay so here's the question here's the question
everybody don't influence him all right let him decide this himself so rags here is your question
okay you got a tiny gandalf with no magic who's four inches tall and he has a knife
versus is the knife wait wait how big is is this a normal size knife that he's having trouble with
or we're told we're told it's a dagger i think in the spirit of the question it is a tiny dagger
that matches his tiny self okay that makes sense versus tiny hitler at a whopping six inches that
is two inches taller than gandalf with no weapon but he's in his prime who wins in this battle
i assume they're both in their prime really um let me see so
that's gonna be i i think that gandalf is gonna win and my reasoning is thus so a two-inch advantage
over a guy hmm it's pretty impressive however um that knife is matter rags i know i know i know
but the knife is a big game changer right knives are quite the force multiplier and i think that
gandalf has way more skill and melee combat than hitler does so even though hitler's got an extra
two inches on him i think that with a knife and a skill gandalf absolutely we win wasn't hitler a
world war one vet though didn't he yeah i don't think he was like hidden trenches so hitler hidden
a trench while gandalf was actually well yeah and this is melee combat if this was like a marksmanship
contest maybe but hold on i also want to introduce the factor that how do we know that hitler and
gandalf wouldn't become lovers eventually well hey the question was who should who would win
because gandalf is not blinded by their passion that's why
i'm pretty sure like given the situation they're not going to be given time to love each other
one of them's dying and it's going to be haylor what is time when love is involved and to be
fair the question didn't exclude the use of resurrection or reincarnation so like gandalf
might have the extra edge there just saying yeah is gandalf essentially immortal like if he is then
he would never lose even if Hitler stabbed him to death Saruman did yeah it's complicated
we'd need law specialists for this one yeah he did Saruman oh yeah and the extended version
you know sorry and i think you mean the v version all right the version the le version worth
i'm sorry i didn't own those versions here we go and then i didn't watch them until college and
i was like holy shit where are these things we'll see we can't even judge it no it's impossible
because we know jay so uh basically regs uh we all agreed that gandalf was gonna win all of us
absolutely like what what all Hitler has going for him in this fight is that he's substantially
taller like two inches like this is like two i was gonna say two inches can we ignore they are six
yeah we scale this like a four foot tall person fighting a six foot tall person that's a pretty
big deal yeah we ignore Hitler's powers of manipulation how do we know that you think
gandalf would fall for hitler shit come on no i mean who knows he uh uh Hitler manipulated an
entire nation and in fairness gandalf had to stay away from the ring because he was potentially
corruptible how do we know hitler uh how do we know hitler wouldn't adopt gandalf to become
like the nazi secret weapon like as he's trying to get closer and closer and stab at him you think
hitler's like wait is this the right thing to do think about this right right then again does it's
a more compelling english and does gandalf understand jim and i don't know i think i think
gandalf is multi-lingual uh magically lingual which no magic though universal trend yeah he
doesn't have magic oh shit never mind no universal trade actually yeah and that knocks out
resurrection and immortality even if they were relevant that's magic right so it's true but you
can also talk about outside influences so like galadriel could probably bring gandalf back
i'm pretty sure we're sticking to just these two i was gonna say we're talking the real hitler i
think the no magic part of the question is pretty much gonna knock out anything like that
in the spirit of the question as we would say well i mean still will live for a long time as
long as you know well i mean we all pretty much agreed gandalf wins but it's not like it's you
know easy like this could be an ongoing you know tiny person battle that who knows maybe
they chase each other weird this is kind of a weird hypothetical for me because normally it's
fictional character versus fictional character but now we have fictional character versus real
person like it's kind of weird yes oh shit i thought he was just the way to shut up argument
someone needs to someone needs to stop him jesus yeah we should also stop coney
20 2012 20 2012
um we can finish these superchas in two hours q 1.5 hour arguing over who'd win between tidy
hitler and tidy cantal we're a very serious podcast shut up some things are very important
to discuss jeez okay next up did you get your albion yet doggo i have yet to decide on sword
or propoon suspicious amount of women in this stream i have um oh yeah um someone had like
deemed me about like their prostitute experience and they typed out a long thing and i was going
to read it but they kept bugging me to read it but it was a lot i was like well chill let me read
it and then like deleted it so um let me go to my emails here and see if because a few days ago i
actually said i'm just a follow-up to make sure i was still in the queue and everything was all
good and whatnot so let me check here with my emel emels um oh they said everything is moving
forward i don't have a firm eta quite yet so i guess we're still looking at the around february
is uh probably about the time when it should be finished and done oh um why not both man
why not both give yourself a sword and some propoon now um wasn't there a computer question
for wags earlier when he was gone was there indeed let me look at my oh my selection's so
huge i really need to not see i got a whole bunch of shad that we can get done uh the next time he's
here it's just the uh no no no that's for wolf wolf wolf
oh there was a hyrax i want to send you the darth bane trilogy is there any way darth
oh it's good i'm actually on the last book of that oh the book i don't i don't know if i got
time to read books i'm just gonna be honest i have the audiobooks if you want them um i i don't
so i guess it depends the summary of it no i don't want no because i don't know yet um
hmm if you see you seem very apprehensive to jump into this yeah i am apprehensive to jump
into a new trilogy of books tree yeah um yeah if you uh if you said the super chat email me
the channel email uh email me there and we can chat about it or DM me on discord
all right um
rags mauler wolf the unholy trinity yeah we're very holy yeah very very i don't know all of the
holes uh we're gonna need a really big roof for this man that's the second joke of that kind
yeah it's very good stuff all right gay movie bulb is yodist baguins
well if yoda says it i don't know uh why did the tree go to the dentist it needed a root canal
getting it
why did the tree go to the dentist yes
i don't know why it needed a root canal
what do you call a cow with no legs um can't move an immovable object round ground beef
oh no that's that's right that works that works it's good what's the difference between roast beef
and pea soup um one's good and one's one's i mean besides the obvious so okay for the sake of the
joke i'll say i don't know anyone can roast beef but no one can pee soup
i guess that's a matter this ends with i'm done what if it's gamer girl pee
well says i'm done i just wanted to tell some lame jokes you nailed it uh petition to rename
the chat maulers into continental liberation force which would be milf milf press one give
milk or say high rags to sign um i've seen articles on how joker only works with arthur
has white yet there was another adaptation of a native son in 2019 and many of those arguments
suggest that bigger couldn't be a protagonist i don't know what native son is i'm afraid
yeah i don't there's nothing about arthur's whiteness and the joker yeah that would lead
him to really do any he doesn't do anything because he's white i would say he could have
been any color under the rainbow including people anyone could be yeah anyone could eventually
become a piece of shit uh the seeds of destruction do was sown when the trash compactor monster
molested luke and layer watched the death nail was the willy wonka umpa lumpas wore furry suits
on endor i'm shaking and crying i don't know what to make of that scary yeah the more content i
watch from critics that defend tlj the more it seems to me that they shape their critique to
counter the people who like or dislike it more often the films themselves yeah that's a big
problem i've always had with a lot of the people we cover they often don't even fucking talk about
the film just talk about everyone else talking about it i mean the movie bob thing we just watched
he barely actually talks about the movie well he had that one bit where he was like i could talk
about all of the reasons why these things don't work but it's like no no no no do that like where
you going stop it i'm gonna talk about columbine blah blah blah uh you guys only do as homonym this
stream well yeah but it's movie bob ah fair point yeah basically movie bob as homonym well i mean i
think they did that on purpose i'm not sure maybe it's ass homonym yeah you want to give them credit
don't you well if i was doing that i would have read it out correctly i i i didn't i just read it
as it was said my ass homonym movie bob as the boulder rolling after indiana so i guess that was
posted before we actually showed the meme of that actually being a thing god this has been an
adventure this efap uh rags we're in trouble it seems like all efaps are gonna be 11 hours and 55
minutes long we can't we can't this can't go on forever i mean it can but we should we gotta we
gotta i don't know if we need to pump the brakes on this or if we i don't know do we need an
intervention mauler what me and you give each other an intervention sit down with us and be like
guys listen what's going on what's going on here this has gone on too long love this initiation
it's about to be and that star was guilty bob they didn't nobody likes have you seen a movie
bob video before ben have you seen have you seen movie bob no how did you manage that you're like
uh you've you've been on the internet fucking you've seen you've seen all of the things haven't you
how did you miss movie bob i'm yeah i'm not familiar uh not a channel awesome movie reviewer
no no no the escapist the escapist magazine yeah
well we we introduced two people to this this this man today and and well they they will be
visiting the hospital probably um they they they are so not a fan is what you're saying oh yeah
let's just say that every but every time we've covered movie bob the majority of the guests have
left with like splitting headaches like no joke hmm yeah we're trying to find a way to you know
sort that out maybe you know me and rags will get to the point where we just transcript his video so
that you know there's there's a lot of visual and audio pain la uh yesterday on dp we had uh
yesterday on dp we had jesse lee peterson and we were just really let's just yes we did wow
he was he not not you covered him he was on it he was on dp yesterday wow interesting how that
goes how that did you call your plan was just kind of like just act like we think he's smart
is basically uh and uh and the funny thing is like we had like billy and i are the the two
main hosts of dp but we have uh our our fair share of regulars so i brought on like our two
favorite regular co-hosts that are also black guys so when he showed up he didn't know what
to do because normally he'll be racist against black people if he's just there with just white
people so like it was like 50 50 there and he's kind of like oh uh jesse lee peterson
uh yeah he's he's pretty popular right now but i i see the people in the chat doing it
but yeah yeah let's be yeah
he was so nice though he was he was really nice to us and really friendly like he's a nice he
does seem like a really nice guy he was yeah he's he's strange i like him but he's he's a
strange man oh he's a lot older than people think he is too he's like 72 years old so really yes
yeah you know like i've always found and i don't find this to be racist black people age better
than oh they 100 percent do yeah um well i think uh surely that's not racist because that's like
though the racist part would be like why are you saying white people age badly i'd be like compared
no but what if i said black people were better at basketball than white people
people would say that that's racist saying i know
but i i mean people would say that's racist well that one's the interesting one to bring up when
you have like representation stuff and you're like should they hire more white people and
like the mba that it's like no they could that's okay i'm gonna find at the next summer olympics
go look at all the fastest runners in the world they all have a couple things in common yeah
and and long legs usually like uh like long legs in proportion to their body
size usually that sort of thing but yes i like they'll i mean it'll be funny because i'll see
like someone running for france they'll be like the the uh 40 50 meter dash runner for france but
they were born in jamaica like these european countries will like uh they'll recruit athletes
from other countries that can win yeah yeah we might be a citizen of france
a lot of them are technically but they they have that problem in the world cup a lot
yeah oh yeah yeah that's totally true all right i'm gonna show you guys this picture
oh god do it okay
yeah you know what i uh i grew up in ohio and uh and and i'm i'm 38 years old and i remember
when i was in my early 20s i went and saw lebron james play while he was in the high school
school i saw him play in high school and he scored like 70 points by himself in a high school
basketball game it's well he graduated from high school and played the nba the next year
i know but i'm saying that's not a lot of competition when you're when you know incredibly
talented at this one thing and then you're playing against other high schoolers that are
just playing it because they wanted to join those sports teams that's why this photo reminds me of
that to see someone who who's like the future greatest of all time playing against a bunch
of high school kids everyone knew right um hey y'all here's some litter litter all free money
hyrah you did hyrah like not even ragged um scooby jew and the dancing israelites oh my
i mean dancing is friendly so yeah not wrong with dancing um i'm gonna have to disagree
with all of you you're wrong to try and rationally deal with people like bob your entire frame is
wrong for an engagement with him these are devil worshiping degenerates who take pride in supporting
baby murder and making reason and beauty rot they're ugly on a fundamental level
oh my god don't reason oh my god one of jared's fanboys is tagging me in your
chat i'm sorry for interrupting one of jared's fanboys is tagging me in this chat right now
jared has fanboy yeah yeah he does actually he does wow anyway sorry for interrupting keep reading
uh it said don't reason with them bully them harass them beat them and that i mean rah you
know that's i don't know about that you're never gonna change minds that way buddy
yeah the thing of it is change their mind if there's no mind to change yeah well the thing
of it is it's all like at this point yeah you're you're absolutely right he's chosen his path
the thing of it is you've got to let him talk in order to destroy himself it's that easy yeah
i mean look at look at majorly if he wants to speak
if he wants to speak we'll just let him go and just kind of watch him dig his own hole well
that's what what you do what you do is like when yasen says like you know uh thingy was good for
westeros like most like me rags and did rotting were mostly just silent because we're like
uh keep that was so painful keep going i guess like keep it's just really the way you're going
you've dug yourself into the pits of the earth at this point but like keep going i guess like go on
i love when rags when you talk to people that are you know the game of thrones supporters and it's
like you don't know anything really too much about game of thrones not to i feel like that
came out wrong but uh as somebody that's not been a diehard fan for as long as the rest of us have
for you to like question them on things because you genuinely don't know and watch them try to
explain it and rationalize it it's hilarious i think the best example was like oh yeah walker
shames sexist that you were like oh they never did it to a guy it's like no it's like the first
skit piss they did it too as a guy but okay and then rags was just like that doesn't sound sexist
uh like what do you want me to do yeah they do it to both it doesn't really sound like it's sexist
but like oh but when they do it to a woman it's worse i'm like okay but she chose to do that
they're like do this walk of shame or stay in prison she chose to do the walk of shame
well the guy the guy had no choice my big old cock flopping around i'll helicopter that bitch
and be like i'm out of prison yeah and the guy had no choice by the way he was just forced into
it immediately um anyway hey wolf glad to see you feeling better and then you're back on efab good
luck with the new channel take care of yourself mate i'm sure you would very much appreciate that
uh he definitely would imagine movie bob floating in the air like peter pan
he's wearing the anti-gravity suit that baron harren and war in the dune movie
serious question more any timetable for tfa critiques will episode three be done by episode
nine or are you waiting for episode nine at this point so um when i finished the redraft right and
then um i started recording uh the first few pages and i said a couple of things where i was
like man those leaks we read like if any of those are fucking true about ray's parents and stuff
i'm gonna have to this is all gonna become pretty like you would listen to it and you'd be like you
saying this knowing about ray's parents there's a kind of thing that needs a redraft if palpatine
is the grandfather or not and i'm just like oh like if i make the video which by the way it's
gonna be pretty tough to make a three-hour video fully edited and the way i do the tfa critique
within a month especially when you've got um a few extra episodes of batwoman coming out and
and efab streams like i'm gonna i need probably two months to make that so it's not gonna be able
to come out before episode nine and then episode nine is gonna very well change the script but when
episode nine comes out what i'm gonna want to cover that and then i want to do the critique
of episode nine to cover in depth and talk about everything that's wrong with it ahead of time so
realistically speaking eat or do anything that you would do and just work on it tfa
i'm totally oblivious to this who is palpatine supposedly the grandfather oh uh i'll i'll go
i'll give you that in a sec i'll just to finish up so tfa is a series it's probably going to
convert itself into a look at the trilogy as a whole while also judging tfa because i mean
it's not it's not like you guys desperately want to know if tfa's plot line makes sense right
like i think you already know especially well there's the thing i want to finish that series
of videos i've written out that script and redrafted several times there's lots of stuff
in there i really like and lots of research so it's gonna happen it's just that um i feel
like i'm waiting for a biopsy diagnosis now like i well yeah for what's going on
on don't be lazy make the video dude don't don't be throwing the lazy word around okay
it's not cool fucking work my ass off like just because i don't make put out as many
videos as fast it looks like i'm apparently lazy like the uh yeah you do it then i mean
that's that's i believe there was a guy a couple months ago on my discord who was like ripping
into the fact that the tfa part three hadn't come out and then a bunch of people said he should go
make it and he said fine i will i don't know if you ever did like oh wow it's it's fine yeah i
will make a bajillion hour long video critiquing this thing yeah so yeah the idea is probably
going to be that the tfa series will be redrafted again once i'm finished with episode nine
and uh it's going to evolve into a series that says something in completion about the three
films as a whole while the episode nine critique is going to be very focused on uh episode nine
specifically um and yeah i know that like it's like wow morris you spent a whole year doing
nothing i'd be like you know i've been working on a shit ton of other projects it's not my fault
that game of thrones crashed and burned like miserably like if that didn't happen there's
a good chance tfa part three would exist right now i mean it's pretty much guaranteed but it
happened and game of thrones was super important so like like to me i mean i really like game of
thrones like just really upset me what happened with this stupid last season so this is the thing
right like it doesn't matter from my end because people just be like you're never gonna make it
it's like oh i will it's gonna happen it's gonna take a while august 2020 might actually be the
realistic result for tfa part three at this point um i have a question as someone who wasn't a fan
of game of thrones didn't the books already tell you what was going to happen in the tv series
the not at the end the books certain part you you could say the books have gotten as far as like
season five and six ish with different points being further behind and further ahead uh season
eight of game of thrones was just blind to all of us pretty much you'd have assumptions but okay
yeah um so so it it started with the books but then got ahead of the books themselves yes wow
amazing that's amazing yeah that's amazing the thing is 2020 might be the year that i release
a whole bunch of shit just because of the fact that this the script is ready to go for tfa part
three or well the rest of the parts but then again it'll need redrafting on the portions
that are conclusiatory about the trilogy i don't care if i just made that word up it works well
enough for my sentence so the parts that are we know what you mean it's a word it's big uh but
all the references to tfa itself talking about the flaws of that they're all going to remain the
same like and each of the tangents i take to talk about specifics in writing like that's all still
there um yeah and you know to to answer so like some of the leaks have implied that palpatine
just straight up tells ray that he's her her grandfather then that's gonna that's gonna
change a lot about how we view all of the films so um so who did uh who did palpatine impregnate
to make that happen leah we're not apparently we're not gonna find out it's two people
it's gonna be one of two parents and those parents are gone didn't they confirm it in uh a book
for the comic book did they in a way i guess uh well i mean and that way so this is the other
problem is there's like a bazillion versions of episode nine right now so well i saw somebody
saying because they confirmed in the comic book that palpatine was the one that created anakin
through shmee so because of that then somehow anakin or as darth vader impregnated someone
which is ray the the easy way to say this is we need to see that fucking movie and then we can
start really easily making definitive statements about things right now we've got ray's parents
are in a box if you will and there could be all different kinds of things in there all at the same
time and so as soon as the movie comes out that box opens that mystery box has its contents spilled
and we all get to see what it is finally i'm sure we're all looking forward to it but yeah that's
the it'll be great that's the thingy and thingy of it and like i said the videos are coming it
just makes no sense right now to try and focus and create a video that's going to be technically
become relatively obsolete in terms of me talking about her heritage there's other stuff in there
that works but i also it's not going to be possible for me to edit a three hour video fully in a
month's time it's just not going to work um the game of thrones the episode three video took
fucking ages um three or five episode five yeah you said three oh i meant five yeah three three
was much quicker because i was fucking yeah i was about to say it's all like that that came out
pretty quick um but yeah you know stuff is on the way and besides efap fans have uh got plenty of
stuff on the way too like there's seven pre-made videos that are just struggling with copyright
right now there's a bonus efap that's stuck behind copyright like stuff is on the way you
that was the longest answer to any question ever i know people are going to get really upset about
the fact that they're not going to get tfa part three before episode nine but fact is that if i
got three out people be like where's four you know it's it's like never ending i've got people upset
of me for not doing this episode six for game of thrones as well and all the video game stuff and
i'm just like all i can do is explain uh my plans sometimes the plans change it's the best
i've got for you guys but i'm never not working there's like not a day where i don't do some form
of work in relation to one of the two channels anyway do you agree that do you agree that episode
one through three in many ways is the story of the rise of palpatine yeah well of course okay
cool okay cool you know what i sit next to billy the fridge who doesn't agree with anything i feel
about star wars at all oh we experienced some of that yes you see this is the thing like he would
have to try it i think because you guys did come on i think he has to try and avoid mentioning any
of that in front of the efap fan base because he'd be like i know tlg's great it'd be like what
what did he say what did that guest just say it's like it's fine it's fine even a few weeks
ago when you guys were on he was doing it again he thinks the last jedi is the greatest star wars
movie ever but he's not sure what he does this thing where you can't he does this unfalsifiable
thing where he says it it might be the greatest star wars movie ever but it depends on the next
movie and i'm like what i mean you know everyone has an opinion right it's fine it's all good
no no open up let's hear how you feel a lot of a lot of people have said that though
movies should be judged on their individual merits
sure no no i don't care if the next movie is the best movie ever it doesn't make that movie good
um yeah yeah so well like so a lot of people said this about tfa because they were like
if if you could pay off the points in tfa well it would it would at least make the movie better
in terms of its setups when i suppose we have to remove ourselves technically and be like well
is that really fair does um it's like really complicated to sort of figure out exactly but
i guess if we're going to say that a sequel can't necessarily make the one that came before it any
better then it also can't make it any worse um right no yeah i don't think it can make it worse
i don't care if it wins the academy award and everyone's like whoa this is genius i don't care
for worse yeah get some of them you win the worst
well like if everyone agrees the next film in this trilogy is just a masterpiece
like everyone blows it out of proportion it doesn't make the previous movie better it doesn't
it could be a plus it could be the new citizen cane of the 21st century or whatever you want to
say yeah i mean i pretty much agree sure it will the thing about the one aspect that we have to
worry about is stuff like recontextualizing something so let's say you know a character
like luke skywalker looks in the head of his fucking family member decides he needs to die
you could have a set of flashbacks in uh episode nine that further inform that and make it more
reasonable all turns out he was a clone that's not the actual luke he was captured he was kidnapped
he was put inside and you know so we're like oh so you have all these judgments about tlj about
this character being assassinated turns out that's not him so like it complicates uh judgments
is it weird that it wasn't luke skywalker dying in the last movie that disturbed me as much as
the green boob milk that he drank no i think that's perfect yeah you know there's a reason
i picked it for my like that's what i put up whenever i say what the fuck at this point
because it's such a moment of just like what the fuck i literally said that in the theater like
what am i watching it's weird sure you know i would rather them cut i'd rather them cut open
tontons for fun and lay inside of them just like whatever it's past time yeah downright comfy
compared i don't know um moving on swiftly as usual uh okay uh anna that three fifth star wars
girl love you anna i feel like i'm more two-fifths with how short i am but thank you that was a very
old super chat yeah we're all i like how i leave for like three and a half hours and come back and
we're at the super chats from the beginning of this dream we're talking about scooby-doo and
the open door poo if cinema can make three thousand six hundred dollars a month nothing can stop you
don't let your dreams be dreams thanks lads and lasses of efap i had a nice podcast to listen to
while i was working oh that was from weekend warrior by the way oh good good good stuff glad
you were able to get through the day with a little help um finally caught a stream live rhino milk
for all yes very generous bob's the biggest one-man case study for physio physiognomy physiognomy
physiognomy physiognomy my my comprehension is clearly dead uh physii physiognomy a person's
facial features are expression especially when regarded as indicative of character or ethnic
origin thanks rah thanks you knew uh there is a photo of penny with a two familiar message from
thomas wane so the relationship is ambiguous on purpose might be true might not high rags hey
um yeah i need to rewatch the film and fucking scroll through each scene in detail to see what
uh what information we really get about everything to do with whether or not there was an affair
between her and thomas wane interesting though uh sargon wouldn't even rape movie bob true i wouldn't
uh the relationship is a big question love you t w on the picture of his mother and wane
um yeah okay it's fair i'm sure there's there's there's uh details that can lend to um uh lend
credence who knows how much of it was true maybe they were in a relationship but maybe that's
all that it was there was nothing else after that
who knows maybe half of it was real then maybe she you know let her mind get away from her and
yeah that sort of thing only just now read weekend warrior super chat we're gonna be here
for years hey we're doing everything we can okay you guys gonna get magog of morsekar on
i have no idea who that is i know him he's a friend of mine cool is it uh you know we're never
against pretty much anybody coming onto efap at some point so good work out yeah um rah don't
throw movie blob the ensuing earthquake oh anna's completely missing the point you people are acting
surprised because you think he's stupid he's being willfully insincere all of these people are
willfully insincere i mean i i don't know i believe movie bob believes what he believes
if you know what i mean yeah like i also it's like he's not stupid he's willfully insincere
he's just yeah it's just crazy he's just sort of a complicated case study to say the least
um putting child abuse in your movie that's kind of cringe bro man who lives in his brother's
basement did you mean mother oh well maybe um man it could be did you say that putting child
abuse is cringe or i don't remember trying to think of what that's referencing but it's probably
still movie bob well i i guess well he was making his movie bop just kind of brushed it aside he did
that sound effect when they talked about the child abuse oh right yeah oh yeah it's like just
this bad noise and it's like what okay so that's not bad that's that's not a reason why he went
and said all right he was treating it like it was like uh oh not a big deal poor you it's like
child and teacher bit um greetings from Paraguay hello thanks mauler and everyone else in efap for
helping me survive my horrible job for more than three months i can't express with words how much
y'all have helped me oh my goodness good stuff yeah i won't do it you can man um i'm here from
that guy who was doing uh 43 hours at work at one time oh yeah that's the same guy uh 43 hours a day
he's being willfully insincere about the facts i mean
yeah but like you know there's a good like do you okay so what would you guys take be
that these people are deliberately lying about the film or that they've got a really bad memory
or that they're stupid and they didn't even comprehend events um mostly the third but i think
there's part of the first yeah i think it's a mixed bag and that there's different ones for
different people in my experience and i can totally see why someone would conclude one of
the three more than the other two but i feel like we there's lots of room with movie bob like
that man's crazy also yeah i feel like maybe he's got his head just really up his ass to the point
where he he kind of misses a lot of things or he doesn't talk about anything or define anything
uh high rags
hey and then it says hola rags
hola hola no no there you go and then it says emba el chapa rags
i don't know i don't know that one either
only one set movie bob has multiple chins why not multiple moves i don't i don't i don't i'm
not i'm not i wasn't i wasn't the artist okay i didn't uh i didn't draw any of it
um but guess what guys he loved frozen 2 is frozen 2 even out i i asked this every time
he may love frozen 2 i don't know what that would tell you about movie
bob let it go guys let it go wow two women on is this ephapocalypse i don't know we survived
so we photoshopped baby yoda fighting palpatine oh my god that's something we argued about today
on dp was like is it baby yoda isn't baby yoda no it's not baby yoda everyone's
yoda's dead how could it possibly be yoda yeah that's what we said but people keep calling it
baby yoda like yeah no no yeah people don't know what the species is called yeah like
it's just a code name it's just easier to say is it so cute oh my heart the species
there's the species name is is not recorded apparently the species has no name oh which
doesn't make sense people would obviously have a name for it i guess but they're the yolo they
originated in 2014 the yolos there's got to be some kind of alien name yeah it'll be great
yeah i guess it's supposed to be all we don't even know yeah sure all right baby it is
movie blob cherry picking his evidence to make his points is nothing new he studied under the
tutelage of anita sakizian in short he's a fraud i mean yeah i can agree with that he's certainly a
fraud like fucking it's nuts watching his videos i don't stand like broad
got him anna do you really want a conversation with bob um the thing is you gotta like that
other super chat said saying i wasn't getting it when you talk to someone like face to face
there's a lot there that you can learn from the person or learn about the person as compared to
you know just not seeing their face and just hearing them talk sarcastically on a video on
youtube so yes i would like to talk to him in person just to gauge if he's actually this stupid
or if he's just putting on a show i would agree with that yeah that's fair enough i mean
i would talk to him i'm not eager to do it but i would talk to him
um teat and titans go is better than captain marvel and the last jedi that's probably true
sure yeah yeah i think i think i'll just by default i'll say that things are better than
captain marvel and the last jedi never seen captain marvel don't you haven't it's terrible
to me to me captain marvel is shazam that is the real captain marvel that's the original
captain marvel didn't people like shazam though from what i know yeah i liked it i actually went
and saw it i always liked that character how it was basically superman but he was a little kid
he had like the little kid mind but he was like basically superman i always liked that
character they had a really good episode of the justice league unlimited with him in it
and they were all making fun of superman they're like oh he's more of a boy scout than you are
yeah yeah i i always hated how they couldn't call him captain marvel after a certain point
because dc acquired that that was like an intellectual property that existed prior to
dc but when dc acquired it they couldn't use the name captain marvel anymore but he's the original
well then do you read the og captain marvel yes yes and it was a man
wow no response well there was also mary marvel too
i'm just think about his madness there's a whole bunch of marvels isn't there because
isn't there the the best friend in captain marvel is going to turn out to be a captain
marvel or something i don't know how it works i just know that captain marvel was a mistake in
the mc i mean if anyone anyone watching this stream right now if you want to know the real
story behind captain marvel google captain marvel steamboat captain marvel used to have a sidekick
named steamboat oh and that's all you need to know just look it up you know what was steamboat's
powers i'm afraid to say anything else like if you look up captain marvel steamboat i get like
now it's like why did dc even buy that property steamboat's powers um cooking
cleaning uh driving a car oh um oh my goodness
wow are you looking at images of steamboat or oh my goodness i can see why steamboat
wasn't in the new captain marvel movie oh no full steamboat oh my goodness my favorite character

glory me it's the day of judgment
oh my goodness this is awful i'm crying
the golden age shake my head
um captain marvel i'm so glad to see you
this is terrible this is really bad
bad oh my goodness like people do this stuff now is parody but back
this is how they are oh what a time what a time oh my god
um after joker kills his mom is he now an orphan
i think we said the rules are that once you're old enough to own your own blood
it no longer counts right right
once you kill your own parents that doesn't count no no if you so let's just say you became orphaned
at an age in which you could own your own blood you wouldn't be an orphan i think that was the
ruling something about that an orphan needs to be able to own his own his or her own blood
um i think that was part of the the deep lore the orphan lore that was the jx c cynic snacks deep lore
very complicated but yeah you could theoretically kill your parents at a high enough age and you
would not be orphaned as long as you've got the certificate that gives you ownership over your own
blood um just want to make sure everybody's clear on that very important themes over substance high
rags hey bubsy for smash bros hey hold out hope it could happen petition to rename movie bob
movie boomer give milk to sign this guy really wants people to sign um i'm waking nights at the
moment and bob gave me the mother of all rage headaches that'll definitely keep me away
thanks cinema roberto thank you and then censored oh oh my goodness um i'll have to catch the rest
on moolah night everybody good night good night did you just call cinema roberto a waterhead
nice that's a reference the reference ben gets right right then he's wet oh sorry i ran away to
fill up a water bottle but i see steamboat is a hit in your chest he's kicking butt and taking
names man yeah he's sitting here right steamboat um that should be the next dc film they they
fucked up green lantern they can't possibly mess up steamboat at this point i agree hello uh rah
get the roof the heavy roof i think he i think he knows he's on it do not read jenny's twitter
she's a complete bimbo oh they allow bimbo on superchance oh in vain as this said she's a
complete bimbo but you know complain who's jenny she's the one that we we criticized and well
the world ended we should have known better moolah please watch seven chaos seven boxes a
funny movie from my country paragway by the way terrejo a japiro tuner a mokoy jaguar tempo love
you all i agree windows d has been shapiro yes um and yeah i have no idea what that seven
boxes thing is but um i guess i'll pop it on the list as one set uh oh that's super right uh my
first super chat free fap wanted to say that you guys make my work day go a lot
easier go by a lot easier also welcome back wolf and hello nags hello and uh yeah good stuff and
if wolf were here you know if if we had rewound by six hours he would have said hello he would
have he would have finally saw joker yesterday i didn't know he came back that's pretty awesome
um he's making his way he's making some videos on youtube as well it's um a new channel of
writing and rage uh finally saw joker yesterday i don't see how anyone can hate this movie it's
uncomfortable at times sure but it was the point right it makes you think no it said nothing that's
what they don't like it makes you think no we've been told it says nothing it's meaningless how
could you how could you that it has meaning wrong um movie bob is the overarching villain of efap
is he oh i guess we covered him quite probably patrick willams if ever we cover him again
who's the it can't be down with thrust because he's like gone and he's also a hero of the stream
now but he wouldn't work it's hard to know these things um also i've created a steamboat meme
in your chat i mean i'm sure they love him steam boat milk steam milk
um also anna please convince me to watch the clone wars it's the best star wars content since the ot
yes smaller watch the clone wars what do you have against watching the clone wars i hate women
fuck you
i'll get around to it i'm sure of it just play it in the background it's really good the writing
gets uh a lot better as the seasons progress and uh it's really good so just watch it how many
seasons is it i believe there's seven wow that's really good is there a new one coming out or did
it come out yes so the new one is supposed to be coming out but the thing is it's so there was
going to be another season but then for whatever reason they didn't make it but all they had
animation done for it they had the writing done for all of it so it was there they just didn't
make it uh for whatever reason and so yeah so that one's going to come out and i have high hopes for
it because everything was already done which i think is why they're going to make it plus
also the characters and the show was actually pretty popular so uh yeah but i would highly
recommend if you guys haven't seen it to watch it it's really good all right and whenever they use
the excuse oh well it's for kids just throw down the clone wars be like that was for kids and look
at how well written that was this so nice i'm gonna feel the same way like i'm a big trek fan
and i always like star trek the animated series like a lot of trek fans consider that
actual canon and people like that more than a lot of the uh live action series that they put out
really i don't think i've ever heard anyone say that they like the animated series better than
any of the live action really i've heard plenty of people say that i wasn't even aware there was
it we're just talking to different people man the war of the anecdotal evidence i'm actually
a bigger trek fan than star wars and i've been to the big cons in las vegas oh me too and i yeah
yeah like i've heard people say they like the animated series especially like well a lot of
the people who are in the into anthropomorphic animals like that you know the the tiger lady
lion woman character so yeah star trek freaking nerds watched man stuff like star wars
like star wars star wars well there's lots of man stuff in star trek
star trek is more cerebral and takes more thought yeah i believe there was a um the distinction
between star trek and star wars was an interesting one one is science fiction the other science
fantasy and science fiction is what star trek was because that's put very well actually i have
something that you guys will appreciate let me find it so i have a very long screenshot of this but um
years ago somebody on facebook decided to intentionally piss me off and they decided
to post on their facebook star wars versus star trek ready set go and uh i i tend to write very
long things when i think that uh the argument is uh invalid let me find this and share it in the
chat so you guys can see just how uh excessive this argument was for me but uh i'm one of those
people that star trek and star wars are so different that you just because they're sci-fi
does not mean they're comparable right hmm i agree you'll appreciate this you you will be
appreciated i'm excited to share this with people that uh will understand the context of this all
right here you go hopefully it upwards so how do you how do you think pakkard will be
what are your expectations uh i am very skeptical just based on what they've been doing especially
with discovery and all the people that are running it and then after watching the series just
i mean remember when pakkard tried he even considered after what happened with him when
the borg and how he went back to the vineyard he saw his brother and everything and then he realized
you know he had that job offer on the alantis project he's like no i i need to be an outer
space type of thing and then later on when he gets that message saying that his nephew died and he's
talking to dana about how nobody's going to carry on the pakkard line it's going to die with him and
his brother and he's you know debating about life i was like they need to watch those two
episodes before they write this because based on the trailer it doesn't seem like they even took
into consideration his reflection but there you go what you're referencing what you're referencing
is part of the next generation and then part of a film yeah i know yeah yeah so and and like the
canon between the films and and it's a little show little off yet but mostly consistent
um but there you go there's my shutdown of the debate between star wars and star trek
oh my goodness i don't know if my full name is in there join to join to put it on screen or
uh that's why i said i don't know if my full name is in there i just realized that
well i can i can just not it's it's big chat it's very big that's the point
she wrote an essay and blur it out she wrote an essay you did a long man bad didn't you
i did a long woman bad thank you very much long lady thank you very very true long woman bad
long and bad uh working security for the same play for the third time and i am in fact bored
don bless damn if you're bored on the third time we've been told that this means it's bad
that's that applies to every piece of content ever
um og team titans was my favorite show raven sit on my face oh my goodness
what i hate most about jenny's that she uses the dum dum ha ha we
autismo look to shield herself fans of that shit should be thrown into lava
oh my goodness not even off a roof i don't know well off the roof into lava oh okay they're not
exposed man is that nice exclusive is that house in a safe area if surrounded by lava i don't know
maybe the maybe the lava is just in like a specific like a well and the rest of the the
area is actually quite pleasant i don't know i'm not going to assume things about ras backyard
you know i'm not the kind of not the type to do that um hi mela hello a lot of people end up saying
mela because mauler gets corrected to it it's quite funny so yep hi wolf hi rag hey
got classes in six hours can't catch this one live unfortunately uh probably awake went out
so uh anyway i have five bucks for hearing about fluffy rags also ten thank you fluffy rags
uh hang in there anna bob has killed too many of us
oh for reference we covered a video another video memes and then started super chats and
according to these super chats we haven't even gotten past the first video yet
oh no yeah yeah uh good to hear you again wolf i'm sure you'd appreciate that uh that's a pretty
nice kind of problem to have though i mean yeah we just got them my issue is like i really want
to get to everybody and so i don't like you know we're not gonna be able to finish these in time
chat i know this is a huge shock to you like we're about to hit the cutoff we've got we've
got literally 12 minutes no 20 32 minutes 32 minutes um we're gonna have to come up with some
thing well i don't think this is going to be a consistent issue this is because we had a bleed
over before then we had a bleed over again and during our super chat read we we had several
people here that's also something that slows us down a bit but not in the way that i'm saying
like oh you guys should leave i'm just saying that that explains it um we could you know the
the aiden solution was to just have a super chat stream um we could do that after this one but i
don't know how much energy is remaining in our cast today um yeah it's it's almost four in the
morning that doesn't you always say that like it means so we never know where you or when you're
sleeping oh i i'm tired that's it nailed it the all you have to do is just say you've been up for
x hours i don't even know how long i've been up so um the plan is probably going to be that we'll
pick these up on and i can't believe it like pick them up as in we'll go from where we left off
uh on sunday night which is going to be an efap we've already got topics and guests set
so um yeah yeah i know that the idea is that they could stop bleeding over every stream we're gonna
i think with the sunday one me and rags will make it so that it's me and rags right and we'll we'll
we'll nail it okay yeah i think we could pound them out you know yeah we're efficient the two
of us are very efficient yeah so for the first five hours no problem just mauler and rags
sure yeah okay anyway i'll carry on and we'll do as many as we can before we hit this cap
all right what i hate most about bob is that he's fat and ugly what that's oh man
god goodness that's raw for you he's just throwing them all out tonight firing all cylinders
uh in 2019 the wane killer would have vlogged it
yeah i mean probably imagine the amount of coverage all of that would have gotten in
2019 the uh the riot portion of joker god i feel like a cutout rags is perfect for rubber ducking
i need this in real life right now rubber ducking i guess how is he referring to the
little the little paper cut yeah maybe like having a little rags float in a bathtub or something is
that what that means i don't know um it's like a debugging thing oh it is
yeah um it it's it's a method of debugging code rubber duck debugging and software engineering
rubber duck debugging is a method of debugging code the name is a reference to story in the book
the pragmatic programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their
code by forcing themselves to explain it line by line to the duck
all right yeah use rags as a little duck that's fine and that's it um rubber ducking also um
so there's a few other ones uh rubber ducking is used to describe the act of sexual intercourse
between two females while using a strap-on for penetration i yeah okay but it is a term for
ball tapping uh it is also used to describe the act of slapping a woman's breast to inflict pain
when one does either of these actions they must scream out rubber duck or rubber ducked the first
person to ever ball tap someone under the new name was nk from pennsylvania at about 4 30 pm
what the first time a breast was slapped under the name was about 10 minutes later by a kp from the
same state what the fuck that's oddly specific so i don't i don't know what they're talking about
when it comes to rubber ducking yeah well i mean there could be multiple things i'm gonna go with
the debugging one that seems like the most likely even if it were debugging why a rubber duck of all
things i don't know it's from a story rubber duck well you could be like why why is luke in a farm
you know moisture farm you could ask all kinds of questions dude like come on more like rub rear dick
on some i don't know oh man oh ho ho even you you're unimpressing dust bullshit now right
you are deflating him it's not important inflating deflating me like a rubber duck like a rubber
mover bob like a rubber bob all because someone said rubber ducking and then we had to find out
what it meant yeah i know it's not our fault it's the super chat you have to blame what efaps are 37
hours now yes we have to discover and research rubber ducking um does movie blob have any
surviving brain cells does he just vomit up weird salad thinking it makes him sound intelligent
i'm not gonna say that's not the case i'm sure he thinks it sounds very intelligent he thinks
he's very smart he's a very smart man yeah he he barely uses any periods when he's doing his sentences
that makes him smart my mom has experienced multiple friends end their lives due to mental
health issues in the 80s this movie gives a visual to the people who have no idea how bad it can get
makes me appreciate it even more i mean yeah suicide really big in the 80s oh i don't know
about that but just just general mental issues it's just like there's never gonna be a time
where that's not a thing cocaine cocaine yeah kerry fissure did cocaine in the 80s and now she's
dead that's true there you go uh correlation why is heath richard still alive yeah it made him
stronger outliers always outliers uh joke i think maybe kerry built up a resistance to it
yeah joko is on the jab pills doesn't it make sense not gonna say it doesn't yeah my mother
was bipolar and she constantly was changing meds and had an entire box full of her medicine so she
yes she took away more than seven pills and still lived oh yeah so ben one of uh movie bob's points
was that if you're taking seven forms of medication at the same time in the 80s then you should be
comatose i don't you know i don't uh is that the like till this day till this day you should
still be comatose no just it doesn't even necessarily matter what the pills you're taking
off you're taking seven that should put you in a coma that's all it's rasp friends of viagra some
i don't know sleeping pills we even included the possibility of placebos fucking water pills
just like sugar pills but what about like some herbal remedies too seven herbal remedies would
that put you in a coma i don't think so yes um i made a know your meme page for efap
i have no idea how know your meme works but i mean it'd be pretty combo what is efap as a meme
that'd be pretty difficult to explain wouldn't it how goodness we are an umbrella of memes we are a
meme factory as they say we're a category category i just read most of that essay we uh we we got the
edited version of the essay too if you want to put it up i see she uh oh do you want me to scribble
out my last name i mean she she re-uploaded it it's wow like this is like my uh my thesis of
my junior year of college right here you know what's funny is when i had to take the sats
the first time i took them the essay portion was asking are people born bad or people created bad
and so i wrote it completely about star wars and you know the arc of anakin versus the arc of luke
and like bringing in all the star wars lore and i've i was actually pretty proud of it and i'm
surprised but i got a perfect score in the essay section of the sats for that one and i was like
this is the greatest moment of my life like i don't do well on test but i i'm glad that whoever
was grading that was probably a star wars fan but then the second time i took the sats i
got on where you had to write an essay based on some quote so i tried to relate it to star wars
and star trek that one i didn't get as well of a score but i also was very hungover but still
kind of was all the same along the lines of this one but yeah well reason don't go to school stay
home and watch movies yes they teach you everything like as jenny pointed out joker
teaches you that medication is bad just all of it don't take medication people
and see nobody's actually like you know countering this so it's clearly true
like i wouldn't be able to say something like this without it being true if someone had criticized
it so it's you know just saying everybody here agrees with it automatically i mean i'm i'm not
a doctor but sounds good to me um a girl in college told me she quit smoking and her
oxy addiction for me uh bitch was my stalker i bet if they made a film about her issues this uh fat
oh my goodness fat fuckle i think he was going for a k would uh love it but because arthur's a
white guy oh screw his movie i want bobbed ed i'm gonna have aneurysm trying to get past filters
oh yeah that probably explains all that it's lots of different words he wants to get through
this tame versions of all of the words you're using right you'll be fine just use just use
those good old tame ones get right in there no problem um an efap on my birthday with wolf what
a marvelous gift oh there's a couple people's birthdays things e-man and uh yeah that's so let
that's three now yeah wow what a marvelous gift also high rags hello anyway keep up a good work
of brightening my commutes to uni cheers all right good stuff efap is definitely good for commutes
weren't you even saying that about your old commute yep i mean i used to listen to drunken
peasants when i was going to uni oh yeah i was i was there for a lot of the uh the big events
especially the the i was there thing with the sitting oh man oh yes
yeah that that was impromptu uh as well uh brett showing up for that stream was not planned
whatsoever so yeah there's there's quite a bit of history there it was epic uh q for all flat
earth or two i don't know i don't think so bread just vanished from youtube again recently for
like yes for the seventh time seventh you sure is that few
you're right it could be like 20th for all i know
cue for all favorite indiana jones film also high rags uh last crusade is my favorite last crusade
yeah i gotta agree they're all good though that's the thing you're all good
i enjoy them all well not the fourth one oh right that doesn't count though
um black block exists since the 70s it's not anonymous anonymous sorry
that's probably in reference to bob talking about how it's referencing something that's
out of here and stuff that whole video is a real headache honestly thinking about it again like the
whole they're pulling things from timelines and they're not allowed to use them in other timelines
that's bad it's like oh oh hit my soul is the theme of this video that we shouldn't take our
insulin bill bob bagman 1940 it could be weird how movie blobs speak so fast spews so many words
that his audience yet says little of substance big fan of you lads and lassies by the way i hope
you're enjoying the show thank you thank you thank you yeah this one just says wolf check your twitter
i'm assuming it was about memes it probably was should i bring billy the fridge in here right now
to plead his case about star wars no no well we should we should stick this over we've got we've
got less than 20 minutes to get as many of these oh sorry sorry go ahead go ahead like i don't know
if you've ever done it bad but we're about to hit the uh the youtube cap i think you have right
oh yes yeah yeah damn it youtube for not telling me ifap was live anyway rags mauler wolf if you guys
are enjoying the mandalorian definitely check out the clone wars and rebels there's some tism but
they're good rebels is not as good as clone wars that's all i ever hear i haven't actually heard
the reverse ever it's always that the puzzles is better there's certain episodes that are really
really good but it's really hard to invest in certain characters like harrah and zeb are awesome
sabine gets better with time but the two main characters edra ezra and canan
ifap's IMDB page has a higher rating than batwoman so ifap is officially better than
batwoman all right guys we did it that's an achievement we did it we're better than batwoman
yeah thank you it's a feature hi mauler hi wolf hi rags hello hey
also hi rags and hi anna welcome to your first official ifap as guest and hi jay longbone hello
hello hi i'm watching about two hours behind but i wanted thorne to be my tig biddy goth gf
i mean so it's a fair choice from what we understand a lot of people are going with thorne
tig biddy uh laugh my ass off bernie gets was chewish not white chipmun that's from rah i i
remember that was the article i think he brought up right from 1980s i think um has bob never heard
of the opium war well this is the thing it didn't even matter if he was like oh it happened in this
timeline so it can't be here it's like why why can't there be a drug issue like at any point why
does it have to be a specific timeline and date anyway but there's also referential things that
actually match so the whole thing just hits like it's like why don't you point here bob
has bob never heard of a treadmill i i'm i'm sure he's heard of them he's aware of their legend he
had he got tired just thinking about him um snl was in the 70s as well
it was i don't know i don't know when it's an snl started that's i'm not sure let me check uh
when did snl start october 11 1975 no kidding wow yeah i thought that started like in the
mid 80s no no mid 80s by the time they hit the mid 80s they had like uh eddie murphy and all them
the original cast was den acroyd chevy chase uh you know that that era john belushi
so yeah it was like uh it was you know late mid to late 70s um nothing funny just want to
support thanks guys and gals thank you uh insane scarface impression on my page
okay the same scarf all right good stuff man uh i talk with schizo's daily seven pills is a good
day yeah well he said it's okay today it's not okay back then because it's different
maula invite me to the stream i have opinions too okay i mean you know as you can see with chat
we've got everybody has opinions oh yeah opinions are like look at ryan conley he just said bill
murray that's an opinion you can't deny that he was not an original uh sno cast member but he came
around uh very early uh while i hate the idea of a joker sequel i'd love to see a series of
batman rogues films in the style of different directors ivy as by john carpenter riddler as by
david fincher etc your thoughts sure yeah i mean this is the the problem we start to get to
when you highlight like oh imagine this with this and this is just like just good stuff
give me some good stuff like a little bit deprived of it for the high budget areas of
movie making billy just told me that he's very disappointed in you all that you didn't like the
last jedi this is this is not the audience for him to say that i know i just want to watch him implode
we we've that already happened right we debated about it for a little bit i know but he'll do
it again he'll do it till the end of time like he'll he will defend it has he has he seen my
series of videos can i just ask him to watch them and then see what he thinks i can ask him i mean
the problem is i don't know if he has a free five hours so that's the problem i did i watch them
though because i watch a lot of stuff while i'm setting up stuff for stream so i watched a lot of
your stuff did i have did i make you leave even more no no i'm not easily influenced if i like
something enough it'll take a bit to sway me i just didn't like i didn't like i i haven't like
the first two movies of the the newer trilogy um the first one seemed way too familiar to me
and then the last one just didn't make sense and but yeah what one thing that did make me like it
less was you know when you take that big fight scene in the throne room and slow it down how
it doesn't add up you think that's something that they would yeah you you think that's something
that they would examine frame by frame and make sure at least that makes sense yeah um but i
think there's a mindset of as long as it can trick people and i'm not saying that
in like a disingenuous way they in a filmmaking sense they're like as long as it's fast enough
that no one can really tell it's stupid but that's not really that's lazy yeah like that's the
problem uh there's a lot of filmmaking elements that get corners cut as long as you can just make
it look like it sort of looks okay um and i'm just i don't know why they would they have access
to just the best choreographers and all these people and all this time and money and just
like come on guys make something incredible do it yep um oh here comes another one hi i do
stall's impressions on my channel um if you want to check out stall's impressions it's a channel
called gin kid a uh strange method in trying to get it's it's j-i-n-n-k-i-d all one word
uh hope joker sequel is sorry yes gin kid uh hope joker sequel is good but i prefer no sequel
yeah i mean i a lot of people feel that way i it's just so unlikely a sequel would be as good
as the first i guess and then we just really hard act to follow and then we're all going to
be very worried about the ruin element please don't ruin um lord of the rings would have been
better if it was set in modern times instead of building sets and costumes and all that dumb stuff
agreed is this mother hubbard really complaining that they put too much effort in bob you absolute
spoon oh mother hubbard 20th century fox released the trailer for the call of the wild and it looks
like garbage it was a jack london classic and how harsh the alaskan wilderness is but now it's been
turned into a boy and his dog story i've heard that harris and ford is in that trailer and
apparently there's a really badly cgi dog that's all i've heard anyone else know anything about
this i i think that if you if you're going to have a dog in something it better be done well
quite frankly i agree with that call of the wild apparently it's awful uh call of the wild let me
i've seen it call of the wild yeah i've seen that film before um i guess there's like a new one coming
out because the trail is just released for it apparently it's horrible yeah really from
20th century fox which i thought they were done now because any media from them is disney now
right or i guess they stay i don't know i i probably don't know oh wow we've literally got
under eight minutes or around eight minutes okay it's the prequel to white fang all right
yeah i remember that hi there rags i'm doing fine water may not be wet but does light shine
yeah all right nailed it in movie blobs review of joker he says the along the lines of this movie
has nothing to say and won't shut up oh the irony agree well i don't know i don't know if not light
shines i mean you would say that light is light light has the property of doing the shining but
then the shining is just the light you know the photons and all that stuff so i don't know i had
to think about it that's fair i'm not sure maybe ponder further you know maybe you'll ponder further
uh this video by cinnamaro berto sounds like a fast-talking jab nickels like what the fuck did
he watch also hi rags hey movie bob sextal is jab nickels giant porg oh no jab is in there
don't do that oh no or jam uh i mean i lived in a basement apartment when i was a kid
well like i said i i'm sure it's a real thing it's just the fact that he refused like it's
i did like i i'm assuming it's just his parents house in which he was living in their basement
and he called it a basement apartment seems unnecessary when you just say it's a basement
trying to make it sound a little different from what it probably is i don't know sounded funny
to me that's all uh chris duckman gives knives out an a-minus he called ryan johnson a master
filmmaker who can write full write masterful scripts with great plots and characters
oh of course okay chris all right chris chris now that's a full circle reference
chris movie bob is self-partnered get it right guys just like emma watson
oh i heard about that people aren't single anymore they're self-partnered emma watson
yes it's all guys
she's a woman of series feminist woman um efap this is my last of my free sc take it from me
very well thank you send film robert back to the abyss from whence he came
i mean pretty much i don't we don't really have any intention to cover him anymore now unless he
has a super tism take but i mean that's pretty much what i would have said before joker came out so
yeah you know he could be back at any moment dollar because rags likes aquatine
yeah man it's a weird show but it's good stuff oh aquatine hunger force
yes okay yeah this is fun it's hilarious i like that show uh professor excessive weight
i get it rags my apartment is above ground movie bob me an intellectual basement apartment yeah
like i said it was just strange to me asshole uh my podcast grows with an awesome length its
jeb tells me to defeat you now take this my wolf my rags and all of my n-words objective mauler
sword okay uh love all your steamboats huh oh i'm sure there'll be a super chat that mentions
steamboat once i get to the end of this list uh love you dog daddy thanks for getting me into pc
and mauler i watch both your videos while at work 12 hour shifts hey there you go i'm starting to
notice that there's a lot of fans in efap who work long shifts and have long commutes it's no
coincidence i think the long man content has found a long audience yeah well see i have been
thoroughly informed that nobody watches this oh nobody sorry guys no one would no one would
no one why why would they do not even nobody yeah it's just too long nobody does that
um it is long and i think i am going to go to bed i appreciate you guys having me on
no problem mr ben thanks for popping in people go to bed early thank you so much you guys have
a great night you too thank you bye bye goodbye uh bet queen and slim causes race riots where joker
caused no violence queen and slim what's that
anyone in slim queen and slim queen and slim yeah i mean i'm not sure that is yeah uh also this
one just says mauler sorry sad face no no it's okay no uh there are days when my fondest wish is
that eugenics hadn't been tainted by racists and nazis you call them weekdays diabeto he did say
that yeah diabeto don't forget the mad lib super chat from last efap oh see we actually
sorted that out right at the beginning didn't we uh that's bullshit sorted it right out nailed it
what's funny is like the last word we used objectively it actually like fit in perfectly
at the end objectively speaking oh yeah maybe he switched them around to make sure it worked
perfectly but i am okay with either of those results okay um occupy wall street was subverted
by corporations that deployed the progressive stack to kill the protest this this fat ass
knows nothing about race and protests i mean that wouldn't surprise me to be honest with you
you know nothing he says a lot of stuff we're just like bob what are you what are you getting
that from bob um explain bob has any of you read movie bob's book it's a diary of a madman
no no his book i didn't know that that existed uh let me uh movie bob book um he's got
let me check
super mario bros 3 brick by brick more than a strategy guide bigger than a retrospective
he rolled new look at yeah oh my goodness um a whole new look at one of the greatest video
games of all time film critic and game journalist bob chipman attempts the most in-depth analysis
ever of his all-time favorite game it is it's only 2.2 out of five stars after 110 ratings so
um why are you guys doing efap 61 efap 62 is coming out well this is efap 61
right there is no efap 62 yet lies lies and slander even though there will be any
second with the bbc letting it exist but you know we'll get there you guys have girls on
ew hashtag woman bad oh i guess you could say woman bad it's okay everybody's bad that's how
it works woman's even chat man bad uh don't forget the diabeto wrote a book oh wow what a coincidence
some uh super mario bros 3 brick by brick where he revealed he literally wants to be mario and
pretends he is mario often oh my god is this true he reveals he wants to be mario
well you know whatever works keep in mind by movie bob's logic he cannot possibly like
ghostbusters 2016 since it was primarily a carbon copy of the acryroid one
um i mean i'm sure you would spin something i don't i don't think i ever saw a video from
him on ghostbuster 2016 i'm sure he made one um wouldn't surprise me also i'm gonna have to say
we probably stop there we've only got a minute left i want to make sure it doesn't bleed over
too much to where it gets cut thank you all so much for watching and for the memes and the very
kind donations and the guests for coming on for as long as all of you did all relevant links are in
the description and i'm sorry we didn't get to all the super chats we will uh carry them on on
the sunday efap which will be 11 pm gmt gonna be doing one of them australian ones and um yeah i
think we will we're not gonna we'll probably do like no memes on that stream and go straight into
super chats and try and get this all caught up um so yeah just a couple of days folks and we'll
we'll see you there anything else you guys want to say before we close out
that's gonna do it for me yeah i think i think i'm all set uh sorry i had to take off for a while
uh i am super tired right now though yep same for me and since we're running out of seconds
we literally go seconds uh i love you guys bye everybody it's good love you bye bye bye
he punches bad men
