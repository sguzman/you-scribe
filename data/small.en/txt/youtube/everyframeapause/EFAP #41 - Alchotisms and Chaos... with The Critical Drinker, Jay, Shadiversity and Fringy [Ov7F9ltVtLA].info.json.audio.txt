you have been saying that I've how many should we how many of you drinking how
many of you how much are you drunk well I had three quarters of a bottle of Jack
when I started and now it's down to a quarter so I'm less than a quarter I
think I've drank almost all of the bottle of room how much how big was this
ball I respect your ability to stay somewhat sober it was a bottle of oh it's
one liter not bad not bad but it was over the course of seven hours so what
Captain Morgan's 75% that's how much you know it's 35% so half of what rags his
lie was
wait what I left before I realized what was happening
35% that's what I was drinking a liter of that's that's quite a lot you're a
lot I'm a parking lot yeah hopefully we are live with a new thumbnail a new link
I really hope this doesn't add on to the previous one that will be really
embarrassing oh are we live right now I've currently I said that already and
you guys like oh we are alive all right this is the time that we're faces
gentlemen we wish you've made that clearer I wouldn't have said so many
slurs yeah can racial well cuz before we actually came online Jay and I were
discussing if there was a you know what it would take to repeal the
Emancipation Proclamation is that the musical well I think once you get
control of the Supreme Court I think you're in your quids in do you think the
Supreme Court is a pretty vain name for them it's like with a supreme the
Supreme Court for me I prefer the food court why can't we just call them the
court also is there another court I don't think so I think we court the big
I would like to go to a level above that and like the ultimate court or
something is McCord the best court
the court you know while we're waiting for everybody to come back and prepare
for this amazing thing that we're doing I guess I'll set up us looking at some
of the memes that have come in oh yes give me a sec but uh sausage raider yeah
we'll get to it Jason up with your over exaggerative exaggerations all right I
desperately need to see sausage raider we're gonna get to it I still have the
TLJ script up as well figuring out why everything is terrible you're not seeing
a stream wall the chat is saying it's up I mean I believe I believe you we
also have a meme video but we will address the meme video once we're done
with the video we're currently on okay never and yeah it has archived if at 40
so this should be 41 now hopefully everything works that way I never know
anyway yeah this will only take a second we got some some memes that not
everyone here will get don't worry shad if you're confused by this it'll only
take a second and you'll I'm confused very easily and just I guess in the
background so if you hate kids screaming that's just mine don't worry they're
killing each other oh we won't we won't worry I just realized the wolf didn't
love and I was like something's wrong I was like oh he's muted there's no way
wolf wouldn't love this wolf wouldn't wolf would always laugh at the prospect
of a dead child no that's not what this is yeah he would okay we'll have wolf
why are you not here how do I do memes if you're not here you piece of shit is he
getting another burger another burger to pile on top of the other two burgers and
a pizza this is gonna be fucking crying tonight we're at the point
where do you think this was two statements related duo of true evil can
you swing off it though I hope there's a patch for that okay what's this I hate
yellow wolf wolf go to the first scroll up scroll up well scroll is that Lara
cropped in a saucy scroll of true evil there we go this bullbeams even lower
friendly it's Medea with the gauntlet and a rolling pit or rolling what do you call
those rolling pin that's correct the first time how did it feel well I wasn't wrong for
the first time in my life that's I like the idea of a film where rags and the dawn hangout
I want to see it mmm so is Medea the villain here is there's something else going on she
would capture normal you reckon she got the infinity gauntlet isn't that the e-fap I think
they said was the e-fap gauntlet he's wearing the one from that previous piece of fan art
that we had remember wait the one with like the one that had like pictures on it as the
I can't remember if it was that it just it had like features from all of e-fap and stuff
either way it is time to see Beowind's creation sausage raiders and the adventures of pipe
that's the stuff of nightmares right there oh the weird folds in its body
yeah this is horrible but I like blessed pipe bad as a pipe
oh it's it's gorgeous and disgusting horrifying and incredible same time it's
Beowind it's just and nutritious I don't think that's delicious yeah I don't know if I go that
far axe you're a weird man what nothing so um yeah we got to make sure the pipe man sees that
at some point I suppose um either way that's it for bonus meme round back to the video right
is everyone here Chad are you here uh yeah I'm here beautiful boy we still got three more minutes of
this bullshit fucking another video to respond I should only take us like three hours so tempted
to just pick up my switch and play Zelda or something until this is done 60 that's what
critical drinker demanded right 60 fuck that okay easy map on mario card that doesn't qualify here
because this stanos isn't the same one who killed half the universe so that's a limitation on end
game's part and the topic for another day the last gen i meanwhile features an emotional
confrontation where Luke finally redeems his failure not emotional how does he redeem his
failure okay so this is this is the whole problem in concepts like first of all we have to identify
that it was a failure secondly how is it that this theoretical failure was even redeemed
you know what I mean we're stuck at every single part of this assumption you could just you could
just as easily argue that Kylo failed to listen to the teachings of Luke as a Jedi master and
failed to redeem himself in the moment where he could have everyone failed everyone's fucking
retarded in this movie because ryan johnson's fucking retarded when it comes to like writing
scripts yes emotional so another day the last gen i meanwhile features an emotional confrontation
where Luke finally redeems his failure and saves everyone failure is the greatest teacher as Yoda
said and this final showdown ties into the theme of the movie I don't know nailing it the first time
is probably pretty good uh that's your opinion how does how does Luke save everyone because
I'm pretty sure like dozens if not hundreds of rebel like fighters got killed the good guys don't
even understand what Luke is doing and then luckily for them Rey happens to pick up all the stones in
the back like like if that hadn't happened like everything that Luke did would have been totally
pointless and like how does he even know what the situation is on crate when he when he rocks up
you know what would have been really awkward is if everyone piles into the falcon they lift off
and then um it cuts to Hux on the ship he goes they're trying to escape uh keep track of them
with our hyperspace tracker that we have very much established and then they come out of hyperspace
all cheering that they've made it and then the first order entirely surround them and they kill
them maybe that's going to be episode nine we don't episode nine begins with like oh more you've got
this whole thing wrong they're not tracking for small weather ships remember fuck oh and they can
push we see them out the window almost like you're suggesting that they can hyperspace the falcon in
and out of the space chase and they can carry almost like a hundred people on the falcon meaning
they need four trips to save everybody on the ship no I don't know that's not that's kind of
clumsy on the big screen though that'd be such a shit story wouldn't it's like we're being chased
by the pistol there's nothing we can do oh we can just ferry them out on the falcon one okay we got
that ship remember that we've established even not even just the falcon like remember ray not
rave rose and fin do it on that little transport ship they could probably fit a good 20 people on
there at least yeah it's important like they they jump in ray gets out in her escape pod and she
goes into the the you know flagship of the she stole snoke's ship dude we don't even know what
that thing is or how much it could hold like who knows yeah but they're not they're not tracking
for small ships so it's okay you can do all that stuff that is possibly one of the worst throwaway
lines ever it's like how the fuck could ray of possibly escape the scenario she took snoke's
escape ship you're like oh i was just lying around okay like right over there very
very convenient can someone explain to me what a decloaking scan is
a decloaking scan uh it's called deep nude it's a new app
we we did talk about this the other day but the concept of a technology that protects you from a
scan and thus you create a scan that out does any scan protection technology which is the dumbest
fucking thing i've ever heard of you're like this scat will prevent scat immune things from
being scabbed you're like what why wouldn't you just do this all the time exactly that just call
it the scan the scan wars oh it's like anime it's like we've we've created something that's immune
to x it's like yes but now we've created something that's x plus well we've created something that's
immune to x plus like oh for fuck's sake this is this is what i said to you the other day more
it's insulting to anime enemies better no there's really bad anime no it's a perfect example of like
writing yourself into a corner and then trying to write yourself out of it and then writing yourself
into another corner and just having to constantly do that corner war over them yeah and it's just
like if anyone uses a cloak in star wars from now on we're going to be thinking why don't they use a
cloaking skin they just ran their fucking ship into it exactly what even is what even is a cloak
in the context of star wars like when i think about cloaking devices i think of like
Klingon bird of praise typically you know and a cloak in star wars is just going to be like a
clock you put on your shoulders typically it'll make it so that you're invisible to the naked eye
but a scan will still pick it up and it's like no this is immune to scans too you're like oh wow
okay cool but it's not immune to decloaking scan scans you're like what yeah it's like they have
a super scanner a super scanner it was developed as an experimental blah blah blah it's like someone's
gonna hit you with a sword and you're like i have a shield and it's like yeah but this is a shield
killing sword i'm sorry what this is a shield proof shield proof oh yeah well i brought my
sword proof shield oh no no don't let them touch don't let them touch but i only use it sometimes
yeah not literally all the time i can't believe special occasions like bar mitzvahs and sword
fights it's i'm not even kidding when when the guy says we ran a decloaking scan and we can detect
it's like what why weren't you running that previously it's very expensive and our budget
got cut a little bit last year the whole film explodes when he said well the whole film explodes
several times what part of the radio like if they don't use a cloaking scan every time
what makes them decide that they better use it like they would need some information of where
the ship is or the tesla to bother scanning for cloak ships it's like it just doesn't make sense
someone says regarding the decloaking military advancement
oh so so someone said regarding decloaking military advancement
he's still cut out he's still cutting out oh my god what like what are you saying it's military
like hold on hold on or something okay let's try it again regarding decloaking
military advancement exists that's what hobo frodo said thank you hobo what a habit still about war
you've shed light on this whole situation yeah and honestly i'm not questioning the fact that
they might be able to develop a scan that can break cloak i'm questioning the fact that they
don't use it constantly if they have it they decide we'll just use this one off now because
it that's the whole point is it like you can only use it for like 10 minutes at a time or burn out
your scanners or something like you know you know that the kind of hack writing has to come with it
so we rather cloaking say why didn't you run it earlier we can only run it once per 10 hours
why because it's on a we have to recharge it the batteries can only take so much else they're
overload there's this guy who has to like run a like a little fucking turbine that he's like
running a thing you know like how you get those torches that only work if they have six thousand
hamsters or hamster wheels it's like uh it's captain i cannot do it i cannot do another
yeah i can't change the walls of physics captain fucking terrible movie
it's like riding a horse and you're trying to shoot the bullet with another bullet while upside
down and blindfolded do you remember efap i think it's like efap seven it's the one where we have
logic data we're talking about how to make the bomb drops make sense they magnetize to their
targets and then someone makes a joke about how you have a gun that shoots bullets that magnetize
to their targets to kill them and it's like why you just fucking shoot a bullet you need to
magnetize it's it's like almost like warhammer 40k kind of over engineering to every kind of
possible it's like the army is ran by retard
we we need the exterminatus proko right now i need a double exterminator
we have there are okay so there's three new beams that i want to i want to show just because
shad might be leaving before we can see them so i gotta make sure he sees these
all right all right show me the fun there's two okay sorry i'm very drunk right now
am i the only one who's not drunk no i'm not i'm not drunk i'm just fat i saw that in twitter
all right so a couple of inaccuracies here
uh so this contemporary artistic rendition isn't very realistic i love how the the name
of the boss is a scaly boy scaly boy there we go uh this danger noodle
i think that's what i was like when i saw the stream i was like who's defending
and then you know when when you get bail when making memes after you that's
when you know you succeeded you made it big
how awesome is that dude he got his gambeson and everything that is brilliant i love it
i was only snaking it's what i did seriously though in australia that's it that's enough
justification to get rid of them and i know people people got really ticked off when i shared that in
the video that snakes are protected i'm like you guys have clearly this one wasn't a farm in
australia like oh wait we understand like fucking everything in australia is out to kill you so you
might as well just get in there there are reasons why me wolf rags everyone won't visit australia
it's populated with criminals from we will get on a boat we will we will swim you know go up to
the shore wave to you be like hey man yeah the prison food over there better be fucking stellar
the prison food is grace well so good
so is everyone would you know from firsthand experience to explore all of australia is a
prison what are you talking about oh that makes sense yeah people in the chat are calling you sheds
they cut out really damn it this is pissing me why are they calling him a chat well
shad snake slayer that makes sense i'll take that time
failure is the greatest teacher as yoda said this final showdown ties into the theme of the movie
beautifully it's also beautiful how do you even say that when you said okay hey we made it four
seconds everybody so so beautiful what tell me what the theme of the movie is and how this
it's such a fucking schism readings like those failures the best teacher luke failed and he
learned for a bit there you go best movie ever it's like oh but but let's let's try and strong
man his point right so because that look you can learn a lot from failure so if what what is luke
learning from his failure uh if i was to steal man his point i would then say in response to you
uh luke didn't luke when looking into the future potentially or premonition upon
kylo uh judged too quickly to try and solve a problem instead of thinking it through and
caused a villain to be created and in this scenario when kylo is trying to like say hey
you fucked up you did everything he doesn't choose to deny that claim he simply says
yes and and life goes on and uh you can but but if he learned from that then wouldn't he be trying
to save kylo now but he kylo asked if he's trying to save him and he's like nope nope no you see so
he hasn't really learned from that yet luke skywalker learned the very valuable lesson that
murder isn't always the first solution to any problem that you have sometimes it's the second
sometimes it's a close second whoa whoa if he's learning from something if he if because he
doesn't want to redeem kylo maybe the thing he is learning is that i should have just killed him
then why did i hesitate yeah i was like i should have killed him faster imagine that was the glorious
auk that luke experiences he tells ray you need to kill your family members when you realize
kill them before they can kill you and make you live by my name ray has like a moment where she
introspectively realizes how like glorious and altruistic that would have solved a lot of my
problems if i just killed kylo in that throne room huh yep yeah that was good i'm confused as to this
i said this kind of before but like he goes into the nitty-gritty of the events of end game to prove
that thor uh story is kind of fucky but when he gets to tlj he's only broad very broad and
basically inaccurate so come on dude and by the way it's almost like he doesn't actually have an
argument to support his point he just wants to compare two things that don't actually stand up
to comparison and i just want to say the guy who made this video welcome to come on efab to talk
about this because good god i don't think this second portion of the video holds up to scrutiny
whatsoever go down ties into the theme of the movie beautifully it's also beautiful to see luke
speaking hopefully about the future during what do you mean he says no he says no to saving kylo's
soul he's always been in a dark place throughout this movie that's all he has saving people
yeah he doesn't really come back from it i mean yeah he like depresses me to think of what luke
did in that scene as a positive it's like oh i actually have trouble remembering everything
about the last jedi because i've tried so hard to excise it for my mind welcome to efab yeah but
does does luke at any point make the decision that okay we should keep the jedi around because i
can't remember if he does that uh all he says is that i'm not the last jedi he never says that the
jedi are ultimately a good thing and should continue he implies that even though apparently
i've read leaks and you never know how valid these are that apparently episode nine ends with ray
going on to create a new jedi order that she's leading which fucking infuriates me well of course
of course ray would fuck you luke ray gets to do it imagine her teaching people what a jedi is
like how the fuck would you know just be good at it two days ago i thought they were a myth i'm
basically a jedi master now though oh yeah and for people saying is there anything hopeful luke says
in that sequence i'm not suggesting that there's nothing he says it's hopeful it's just the idea
that he says you're gonna save my soul he says no it's like hello someone said it wasn't murder
it's surprise surprise forever sleep
make sure wolf doesn't leave early this stream next one we'll have him
oh well if you're not allowed to leave now bayouin's got a surprise drawing coming that's gonna excite
this stream apparently it's not much of a surprise now is it oh you'll forget about
it both time it comes around it's what it is will be a surprise just focus on the marinara
i'm just focusing on killing this squid pepperoni racist about the future during this confrontation
when he was in such a dark place the whole movie his death scene is really powerful because of the
visual that's it yeah but we talked about it ironically argue to me why his death scene is
meaningful beyond the fucking visual what does what does luke actually accomplish in this movie
what does he learn what does he do he dies okay fucking nothing frustration we did no end
that if if he found like he's he got like the fucking telegram on this island they go yes all
the resistance died by the way even though you did what you did he'd be like why i thought i helped
i guess i didn't like everything depends on ray having picked them all up from the back
i guess he just knew that because he's omniscient depending on what causes his death because either
it was the projection that made him so weak but then he didn't he didn't die he fought he became
he became one with the force which is an intentional thing so maybe he did it to
just before he was going to physically die so he could become one with the force stuff but
it's all a choice is making he chose not to fly with ray there or anything like that
and the question is why what is it achieving and we yeah that's the thing like did he really choose
not to go with ray or scared i don't know ultimately he sort of overcome his fear
in order to project himself to the other side of the galaxy and then die anyway you guys like
the majority project uh speculation we don't really even know not great the best movies
like when it comes to luke you get so fucking little from this screenplay you have to infer
most of it yeah fuck it like i haven't made this movie movie created my career
it's not pointless shut up that's like saying obi-wan's death scene is pointless watch a movie
first theme no no you can't relate luke's death scene to obi-wan's scene and say like see if you
think one's meaningless and the other one is too how is it that you don't like this movie you could
say that and yeah we addressed this in the last stream as well there's a lot of reason that you
can actually find with obi-wan doing what he did but when you look at luke you just start getting
confused yeah everybody has a different account and they conflict obi-wan like look at his his
character throughout a new hope he always seemed like he knew what he was doing he was there to
impart a bit of wisdom to luke he was there to get him started on his journey he served
a logical purpose within the story we all got it we all understood it then you look at luke
in last jedi and he's fucking nothing he's just this confused mess of a character
the screenplay doesn't know what they want him to do we don't know what he wants what he's supposed
to be he's just there he says random bullshit lines to ray tries to teach her lessons that
don't mean anything it all comes to nothing because he didn't even finish the lessons the
people who wrote his character didn't know what he was supposed to be they resented him even being
in it did i tell you guys like this is a thing that was said by i think it was ryan johnson it's
going to be in part three or four of my tl gtfa series when i finally release it um but uh luke
mark was confused when asked what the third lesson was because he obviously was like it
wasn't one and when ryan johnson is asked about it and again it could be someone else's quote i'm
pretty sure it says uh they say like the third lesson is to be interpreted by the audience
fuck if that if that was that's a cop out like it's like how it's like 101 how to be a shit writer
like you forgot to do x like no it's there use the audience to find it for themselves
have you seen the deleted scene for this which one well where um
there's like uh luke kind of pretends that there's going to be like a raid going on on the island
and it's like well oh right if you if you try and stop this well you know they're going to come back
twice as bad next time that sort of thing and ray can't help herself she runs in to try and stop it
and ultimately it's just like a big party going on with like the local space nuns toes a frog yeah
whatever they are so efap 40 has been blocked worldwide by the way what's why this is a
copyright claim on it so once i find out what it is i'll just edit and re-upload a vision that
doesn't have whatever the hell they're complaining about in it uh don't worry about it guys and i'll
challenge whatever the fucking claim is i guarantee you it's a meme video it's always a meme video
apparently it's from warner brothers so it could be any movie they've made whatever yeah
sorry guys you're gonna have to wait a while before you can re-watch that if you want to
cares about its kinds of creators so i want to talk a little bit more oh sorry keep going yeah i
was just gonna say like even that that scene that was cut even that doesn't know what the fuck it
wants to say about luke and about the jedi and everything because his entire take on that is
like well we need people like you who are willing to like run in and save the galaxy you don't need
me isn't that the exact opposite of what you should be teaching her um so just with also the
running and help people but ultimately you might make things worse because you don't know the bigger
context of what's going on someone said you don't think the third lesson is would it be but it do
uh interesting question from logan looker mola honest question where do you draw the line between
writing a movie to interpreting a movie it's entirely dependent on your references if you
tell me like x happened and i ask you for a scene to reference it and you go well you're supposed to
sort of see that with the between the scenes that we see it's like hmm but if you reference literal
here in like if you were looking at a script or a or like a written version of the play
of the movie is it there if it's not then chances are it might very well be interpretive if you can
reasonably infer it from what you see on screen fair enough but if not then you're just trying
to like write the script for yeah i'm not saying this this is easy it takes a lot of discussion to
really find out the difference but most of the time the easy answer would be you have a reference
versus you only have uh like literally don't you think that you could get that from this scene and
then this scene it's like hmm a good example actually would be uh i i'm one of the people
who tries to defend vision and scarlet witch's relationship but the majority of it is just what
you have to infer would have happened between significant events which isn't necessarily enough
for the payoff they have in infinity war um which is great but you need more time with them being
together and i actually am a big advocate for iron man 4 which takes place between uh
civil war and infinity war and it would be a world where half of the avengers of vigilantes
and the other half have to do work according to the accords and you you get to have scenes
where vision and scarlet witch are dealing with whatever basically you get to an iron man fucking
coordinates with wakanda to invent his retarded nanotechnology it still actually kind of bothers
me that he just casually has nanotechnology and infinity war so it's like oh that's something he
has now a lot of people like don't get it it's because of wakanda and it's like we never saw
that happen but okay as long as you've got the magic bullshit mineral that can like do anything
and solve any problem then it's fine you know and so if someone said their relationship is great
you can infer that they would have spent a lot of time together it's like we kind of need to see that
to enable the moment where she has to kill him being extremely meaningful and i still think it's
meaningful i just think that they're missing out on a lot of power by not having us see them
together more like we get one bringing it back to the last jedi i was going to say like a lot of
people not infer that ray kind of absorbed her skills and abilities from kylo ren when he was
trying to like fuck that dude that's what people do they're like oh well the reason she's so fucking
amazing about everything is because she absorbed all of his skills when he tried to like that is
apparently canon it's in the books that that's the thing that happened is out of bullshit you
can't just say i wrote this in a book and released the book therefore the films make sense now it's
like no i love that the books are trying to fix everything yeah i feel bad for the office unrelated
to the the the screenplay i don't envy the guy that had to make the novelization of the last jedi at
all he must have had like the worst time of his life trying to justify that shit yeah like whatever
you're paying me i want to raise i feel so bad for them because they don't even get recognition
too they're the ones that have to try and fill all the gaps and nobody gives a shit like who even
cares who wrote the novelization of tlj who any names everyone remembers a ryan johnson and jj
abrams maybe that's a good thing though because it's not like those names have a lot of respect
right now in critical corners of the internet know what i mean i have no idea what to what
might be better to not be hated you know it just um it blows my mind that people
like sensible people who are probably quite intelligent in day-to-day life will defend this
movie well they would look at you the same way in reverse they'd be like intelligent people
criticize this movie yeah but i'm always like okay fine tell me why you like it tell me why
it's good have you seen what arguments are usually this is the thing you're talking to
people who do have done i want to say at least five streams on tlj some of the videos man
some of those but it's all it's all it's all based on emotion it's all just like well okay
you know i liked it because it made me feel a certain way it captures this spirit and
that's fine like if you liked it on an emotional level that's really subjective and i'm not going
to take that away from you but like objectively you must look at the scripts you must look at
them that's where you're entering a problem a lot of people think there's no such thing as
objectively assessing art but if you have an objective standard nope to go by
well it doesn't matter who cares about your objective standard that only applies for you
you valued it who cares no but if the the standard is understood for instance like consistency
someone does something that establishes something that's now should be canon and then they
completely contradict it later on you could say quite objectively that that was bad true
but the person's response will be i value the theme far over i value whether or not the space
makes sense that the the bomb would fall at that speed that's the assessment on what an individual
values which is subjective and it doesn't undermine the objective standard that and they
would say that they do not value the the the objective value you've brought up and they
wouldn't even give a about it and my response to that is that i wouldn't i don't really care what
you value in this regard they would say the same back to you well this is what i mean it's like a
spiral well this is why i don't argue that it says it says i don't think you the whole premise of a
fucking story is progression the story is built on the idea of progressing a to b to c to d so
it's not an arbitrary standard this is literally the thing that it is so it's an objective issue
whether or not you consider the standard or not i don't care it's an objective issue so if they
were like i don't i don't care that um yoda casts lightning just because the other force
ghosts don't do shit all in the ot that doesn't mean it's a problem i was like it's a massive
problem an absolutely massive problem it fucks everything up and you go no that's your problem
with the massives it's a it's a subjective issue that you have and no one else does and so you're
full of shit we we need to get one of these people on this dude you need to watch efap with major lee
me and rags debated a man who enjoys this movie it was a disaster how would you describe this for
saying that you can you should just look at women and that's a reason to like the movie i was gonna
say critical drinker you need to check this shit out you'll love it you'll be able to look into
the mind of someone who defends rags you there i it's funny what rags remembers that experience
like i like this is the weird thing i like to think of myself as a fairly person and like
i could i could talk to someone who defends this movie like just you know we'll have a conversation
about why you think it's good and i'll i'll put my points across you can put your points across
but i feel like they won't be able to do that because they'll just get angry that someone
doesn't like it we have experience in the field and we will tell you that it's a fruitless endeavor
but we will continue to engage in it hoping that one day we'll be proven wrong in that assessment
seriously check out the major lead debate fun fact about the major lead debate is that um i
was listening to it live uh and then i was living in student accommodation at the time
and i i locked my key in my room and then listened to it through the door of my room because
and how was that experience jay oh it was really fun i had to wait for fucking hours with someone
it was great and then they were as they were unlocking the door they were like who's this
guy defending tlj and you're like you wouldn't understand that's how long that's how long it
took by the time they unlocked my door uh you were finished and you know how long efaps are
oh no you were sitting outside your six i was supposed to say yeah six out that that was a long
efap from what i remember or at least it felt long i can't remember if it was a long i locked
my phone in my room as well so i had to wait for my flat uh my flatmate to get home so that he
could call people to let me into my room wait who do you think put up the better fight jay the not
so great debate all majorly oh i haven't watched the not so great debate oh dude okay wait uh fuck
i guess i'm the only person here outside of rags who experienced both of them and he's muted so
i who who do i think put up a okay i'll leave it to chat chat who put up the better defense
the not so great debate or mr majorly i'm curious putting up a worse defense than majorly
yeah but not so great debate that was incredible it was not so great right way right reason why i
called it the not so great debate right his argument was based around like not actually
seeing the movie and how to pause the the whole debate while he looked up clips
lots of people are his defense was better because he had kind of reasons even if the reasons were
oh yeah but it was cool yeah it seems to be that chat is either saying majorly was the better
defender or that it was neither of them this one okay i see one guy saying it was the not so great
debate he was the better one yeah this is the thing not a great debate is literally like
disaster oh blessed southpaw said not so great was a better
universe i feel like this is something we should do a straw poll for you know it was a good debate
the arrival debate hey wolf you like the arrival right yeah oh yeah i like other people who said
we were wrong couldn't agree with each other as to why we were wrong this kind of sort of proves our
point the arrival is a confusing movie there's no doubt hey critical drinker have you seen the
arrival i have indeed yeah what do you think i thought it was kind of shit and actually like
i'm gonna say it was a lot more simplistic than it would have you believe like when you
actually boil down the plot of it there wasn't an awful lot going on
is that it that you're with you well i'm trying to think of how i can put this concisely
is that someone with hork high on it yes he he tells the future telling spider if you can if
you can bind to the idea that amy adam is gonna have a kid in like 10 years in the future when
she's already like like uh okay fair enough that that's kind of what it boils down to it's all
about the human kind of bullshit problems that they have rather than the actual contact with the
aliens i have put the vote up
yes i will post it in uh discord for you guys
this is interesting actually i didn't realize so a lot of people do think that the not so great
great bait to great fucking hell not so great debate guy did put up a fight that was
i honestly thought major lee was way better than him uh i think so too i think that the
not so great debate is more entertaining i agree with that actually yeah oh yeah the not so great
debate was like watching a guy to come to some kind of realization like life on air it was like
watching someone lose their religion uncomfortably it was like watching a flat earther realize that
the earth is round you know like they really have that moment where they pause and it's like
just the moment where he's like trying so desperately to defend something and then he's
crying in the middle of it if you're if your vote is neither or both just don't vote you're fine
just do it don't worry oh this vote is only for those who think one or the other was better than
the other mauler is pulling a toe but mauler mauler no vote is a vote for trump how do i i'm
going to divorce you if you continue to vote for trump which means i think you mean don't vote
you can't talk about this you refuse to rim job him but you're complicit in this mauler because
remember trump is literally hitler i don't know is that true is he liter is he the literal
incarnation of heat lore well if twitter's to be believed then he is yeah was trump born after
hitler died because if that's true then he is the reincarnation that makes sense right i mean he is
an old man he is an old man he might not have but he's like 72 or something speaking of 72 it
reached 72 on major lee for a moment there haha and it is once again there we go guys confirmed 72
okay yeah so it's confirmed objectively that it's the absolute truth that major lee was a better
debater than not so great debate guy i can't imagine a worse debate than the fucking major
well you'll find the word the entirety of his arguments were going come on
well the entirety of the debate guy's arguments were something to the effect of well you see
luke is old and oh my god i'm axing you dude this is part of the disney fanatical star wars
universe go back and watch jay tell me what i felt bad for you will because you tried so
hard to pin him down on what the fuck a disney fanatical universe was and he never ever like
yeah i i presume he tried to say fantastical or something like that but i think the whole overall
point is that disney canon means that you don't consider any canon previously i think that's what
his whole point was i i guess he was trying to say like it's that's that similar argument of like
oh it's space wizards with like laser swords and stuff so you can't hold any kind of standards to
it and it's like well i hate arguments like that if you're gonna go by those standards if you're
gonna go by that argument and then like you know you know ray could like jump up into space and
punch the death star in the face and blow up with like a single punch or something like wait the
death star's face yeah that's got his face i i i just thought it was a ball with an anus
it's got it's good it's got a it's got a dish or something you could probably punch that
um what was it yeah i was gonna say though the major league debate you can see it uh there's
a progression at one point so he opens with saying something like uh it was obvious that
kylo ren and ray were in love his evidence in total is they touched fingers and by the time
we talk about it for a good half an hour what he wants us to definitively agree with is not that
they were in love which is what he's previously stood for he moves the goalposts all the way over
to you have to admit that there's something happening between the two of them we're like
there was something okay we don't disagree with that statement you know just for shits i might
watch the not so great debate again because i haven't seen that since we
had it i said that we were gonna i was gonna watch it again but i completely forgot to
i definitely can we get that can we can we get that guy back again major league
i don't know we're fine dude should we go from the not so great debate just get him on this
i don't know no major league made me sad
did he make you majorly sad no he made me extremely sad he made me fanatically sad
star wars universe sad a dis in a in a disney e fanatically way very sad
oh people are all addressing me on twitter saying that efap 40 is down that makes me sad
to deal with yeah no you can tell rags gets like angry at major leo at one point
i think i do too i was supposed to try and be the neutral party i keep trying to like
sort of level it out but i get super frustrated when he starts talking about i like it i like it
how you don't even know the name of the second guy he's like the guy from that debate you didn't
even know who it was i don't even know what it is i don't either major league is the second
oh yeah but that's the first oh fuck i don't know what's happening
uh do you want to say who was in the debate even
that was me wolf and guy the infamous guy didn't have name right did guy have name i don't remember
he had discord name but it's been a year since that happened remember it you know what's the
chances that he's even still alive after all this well he's lying i mean honestly if he is dead
it might be for the better oh people are saying yes so what's going to happen is i'll download
wait if i can download if it's block worldwide can i download efap 40 at that point i don't know
either way it can be a shadow player oh no you can't if it's blocked down uh worldwide
fuck right well i'm going to contest the claim to get it then yes you can shadow play it well
that's what do you mean i can't at this point right because it's what service to download
youtube videos it's obviously youtube premium right because it's the only one you're supposed
to use no i don't use that we will refer to him as runt either way either way this insane
efap double bill will will be delayed before simply i cannot upload part two before part one
so however long it just can't be done nope can't be done it ain't right even the disney fanatical
star wars universe yeah there's speak for part two so make sure you hang on to this url folks
this is the url you have right now you need it bookmark that shit that's the only way you can
view this right now well until it gets blocked worldwide oh this one shouldn't get i'm assuming
it's a meme that got blocked by the way the problem with memes is is i always feel awful trying to
pause the memes because they're really funny but when they do film ones i'm like i want to get
to let it run but then fucking thing is like you're trying to sell the movie to make money it's like
have you seen what we're looking at it's not whatever anyway is everybody happy for me to
do uh to to continue the video that we're i'm really happy continue it was a video yes
we're doing it is there still more to this shut up that's like saying obi-wan's death scene is
pointless watch a movie for its themes and subtleties for once instead of taking everything
watch the first thing can you make this argument to him about thor in endgame don't even go there
i i found the name of the not so great to bait guy oh his name was death and karn and he plays
roblox death and karn he plays roblox oh tell me he's on lane right now can he handle can he
handle roblox did he feel i don't i don't know i'm not friends with him did you forget to finish
the name why would i be wow that's fucking cruel yeah that was a meme also whoever made that picture
that red picture with the three of us discord it to me i want it has he still not done that the guy
who did it may not be viewing right now he's got to wait for him yeah of course he is he might not
be rax rag is he must be and no chat it's not death and karn it it's literally just death and
karn i don't think he understood what oh i love karn is it karn that's in like i love karn in the
it's all one word and it's death in karn and it just ends there so uh there were three more
letters in the word and then it was con like a different area in which death occurs differently
is con like a i guess i think that's just where his brain stops functioning that's what happens
if you die in nebraska death in karn just think though like that debate that he had with you guys
that was like probably the highlight of his life i don't think that was the highlight of his life i
think that was literally the worst day of his life that was a shot that was a shot of greatness
you know he didn't take it i wonder if i wonder if his opinion of tlj has changed since then i wonder
if he death in karn people are saying i highly doubt it because i mean remember that
by the blu-ray of the last jedi right and we were like no that was such a bad moment
anyway we're supposed to be watching a video guys god racist just to clarify is sixth and
the highest number of people that have ever been on efap same time no we've had 12 what i think
that's a lie it's a lie it was he eventually once you actually get past six it starts two rows
so there's like a row on top of this one so it's like a double decker oh damn yeah
nope that's how it works nobody join please i need to invite all my friends
huh i'll invite all my friends okay oh they just got here i see yeah i don't think but
to answer your question legitimately i don't think we've ever had seven no
six is the all right time to get seven froggold are you lucky you would like to join me wanting
seven anyway let's watch a movie for its themes and subtleties for once instead of taking
everything at face value stop complaining that old man cat makes no sense it's beautiful speaking of
what but it doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense and it's not beautiful it's actually kind
of it it no you can't just say but it's beautiful but it's pretty it's it's just like the this is
like the look at the trees god art that's essentially saying because i liked it all criticisms
are invalid but the cinematography but it was so beautiful it was this this is this is where all
these people come from though it's like they're it's all about what it made them feel it made me
feel happy inside so it doesn't matter about any criticism it doesn't matter if it makes sense
all all i care about is like my emotions my feelings are worth far more than any stupid
cold hard fact yeah exactly the thing is though old man cap can make sense how he could be an old
sea captain no if you look at the time travel from apparel dimension at time travel uh it can make
sense yeah jay video i did a video on this guy's yeah how did he get back into their timeline
if he was he traveled into a parallel yeah that uh the main mcu timeline was a parallel timeline
that was created from cap having traveled back in time and so that means he would have had to
have been present the old man cap would have been present through the all the mcu what happened and
peggy kata was uh the one that she was married to was old man cap and he was just hiding off and
she was lying but then he never took part he never took part in any of the the world-shaken
events that were going on during that makes him a little bit of an asshole the question is he might
feel that the good guys did win in most instances and they did bring back everyone from the fanos
and he might have felt that he had already you know had a role to play in trying to save the world
and so he had retired i don't think how did he how did he manage that conversation with the red
skull when he had to return like the soul stone that would have been an interesting conversation
i would have liked to have seen that all right now the red skull is a great villain in the comic
books and if they bring him back that would be cool but yeah i would have to see how did he return
the stone to natalie portman he had to use america's ass he had to use freedom powers i have
challenged the copyright on number 40 i hope it comes through soon but youtube isn't exactly kind
to its creators you'll have to wait folks just just enough it's great to claim in who put the
claim in uh warner brothers they're not as bad as zephyr at least they're like the second place
though everybody is a worst hole with yeah the warner brothers are by far like one of the worst
are they uh i know zephyr's really bad disney have um let go of some claims pretty quickly in
my experience sometimes let go of the absolute worst is zephyr sony pictures yeah zephyr's terrible
one of us fucking suck for that uh all of the videos that i've got blocked in places have been
have you managed to ever uh claim counterclaim and win no i've never won a counterclaim with
them so i don't bother anymore with the one brother's claim because they don't block it
they just block it in dates so well i mean my ultimate thing will just be that i'll
really edit a version that doesn't have whatever the hell they're claiming
you do you claim on fair use oh yeah absolutely dude when you when you literally have a scene from
the hobbit which is what i assume may have gone down because i played the hobbit one quite long
uh with all these texts on the front and all the fucking completely different soundtrack and all
of us laughing and commenting on it you put that in court they would just be like how the fuck is
this you trying to repurpose the hobbit as a as a piece of work to actually have people enjoy
and make money from yeah completely fucking different it's absolutely fair use it's parody
in the highest sense but you know and i wouldn't want anybody who i wouldn't want anybody who's
making memes to feel responsible it's my bad for not pausing enough honestly sometimes i get too
immersed in memes as we all do um every time i get a copyright claim and i say no this is fair use
and i send it to them and if they still dispute it after the fact that means they're saying they
watched it and they're saying it's not fair use i threaten to sue them for harassment because they
know it's categorically fair use i've told them and i'll sue them for the lost revenue and the
stress that it's causing me and every time i've done that they've released the claim but that's
just me isn't it nice though when they release the claim after like 90 of you so yeah that's always
fun so you make fuck all out of it basically yeah it's a full harassment because they know
it's fair use they're just abusing the youtube system it's we're just grounds for the termination
of a youtube account by the way and you can get your account terminated if you do it yeah that's
the whole thing you can go bad if you if you appeal yeah if you appeal a decision that went
against you potentially they can do it only if you get i don't know how often it happens yeah i
don't know how often it happens i'm gonna have a copyright strike i've had to appeal and it was
lifted because it was fair use but it's not nice getting the strike don't get me wrong that sucks
have you had a full strike on your channel then yeah yeah lion's gate the scumbags
oh fuck them hey look uh i don't know if you guys have the same pause as the stream does
right now but there was probably a guy editing this where a laser goes to the behind of luke
and he's cut it really badly the editor the laser has two gaps between luke and the laser
because they probably were limited on the the abilities of special effects at that point
that's really obvious what's happening on it so there's a laser traveling behind luke that's
obviously missing him from a gun they've edited what you need to do at that point is draw a big
red line and then cut it out where luke is to make it look as if it's shooting from behind him
but they've over cut it significantly what i'm seeing on the stream currently is luke with a
lightsaber you shouldn't have seen i'm seeing old captain america you got to go on the actual
stream my actual stream not on watch together i am on the stream page oh no together's where
the plants watch it i refreshed it and it it works so yeah some uh special effects limitations i
suppose it's okay all right i'm gonna draw it back i'm gonna draw it back to 740 just to make
sure everyone comes during this confrontation when he was in such a dark place the whole movie
his death scene is really powerful it's not pointless shut up that's like saying obi-wan's
death scene is pointless watch a movie for its themes and subtleties for once instead of taking
everything at face value stop complaining that old man cat makes no sense it's beautiful speaking of
which that's the final nail in the coffin for thor he has no end game in this movie it really feels
like they didn't know what to do with him at the end compared to the masterful and maybe this isn't
his end this isn't his end he's literally an ex-guardian yeah it's assuming his arc had to
have been wrapped up in that movie and i mean there's already precedent that character arcs
extend beyond one movie with what happened in ragnarok and also infinity war and stuff and so
to assume that i i'm getting i'm getting a bit tired of the whole like thor is not ready for
leadership kind of angle because they've been pulling that shit for like the past five movies
and it's it's getting a bit old now you know like how much more shit does he have to go through
in order to be worthy of leadership no i think it was established he is worthy even after the
first one he was ready i think he actually kind of doesn't want to he wants to be uh uh you know
out adventuring and doing the hero thing yeah he's a free spirit that's not like a character flaw
um because the first movie is like learning humility second one is learning i suppose how
to deal with loss and then third could be yeah yeah how to deal with or how to save your people
when they're facing utter destruction i don't know there's a couple things you could probably
how to deal with more loss basically he loses his dad like i hate to be the guy trying to make thor
one and two really matter as a separate important thing it's it's complicated because fucking those
movies suck it's the same reason why um i adore the rusos for making iron man 3 with it like iron
man 3 now matters in his arc instead of destroying his arc because like you guys like i'll never stop
appreciating them for doing that uh and so what did they do so they they made it so that they made
it so that iron man's ptsd matters while iron man 3 was laughing at iron man for having ptsd
which really fucking bothered me a lot of people are like you think that iron man 3 is bad when it
gives him the idea of a hero experiencing ptsd due to the crazy antics he has and i was like yeah
they also fucking make it a joke in that movie several times while civil war you can absolutely
argue a shit ton of the decisions iron man makes is because he still has ptsd he's still experiencing
problems he's still trying to figure out what the correct decision is and he falters in places and
it's very in line with tony stark's character one of his greater motivators in you know from the
first one and stuff is guilt like and so characters based on the idea that he keeps trying to redeem
himself for the mistakes he makes and ultron is major yeah absolutely iron man 3 is almost like
i have managed to fix everything no no no no no no no no no no no no fuck iron man 3 and then yeah
age of ultron and civil war like yeah fuck iron man 3 it's a shame if ultron had been better
developed as a character as an and as a villain it would have worked so well but as it was he was
almost like kind of a comic clown sort of character yeah uh this is the thing you won't catch me
defending age of ultron i think civil war makes the use of age of ultron and iron man 3 however i
still think age of ultron is better than iron man 3 yeah fucking hate iron man 3 there's there's
some there's some great moments with age of ultron when particularly when he's talking about vision
and like that was his ultimate you know goal for for himself that was his that was his well his
vision for what he wanted to be and that was taken away from him and it is quite well conveyed
that the whole theme of that movie is like potential squandered because of flaws within
within a person within an idea and it carries through with everything and it actually plays
out pretty well it's just it relies too much on like comedy and and humor with with ultron uh i
was so i think that the age of ultron trailer is better than the movie way better and it's a shame
isn't it like the idea that ultron is this extremely menacing realization for the heroes
but in the movie he's this goofy idiot yeah it is hard to take him seriously as a villain
fucking yeah okay well we don't want to get sidetracked we'll continue
really feels like they didn't know what to do with him at the end compared to the masterful endings
tony and steve got in the grand scheme of things thanos was just a minor slip up in the middle of
his story and i don't i don't agree with that at all no not me either like the fact that he blames
himself so drastically for not killing thanos when he had the chance that's that's a big thing
for his character arc and it seemed to me and when he's with the guardians and he's like where are
we going what are we doing lol and he's kind of back and forth him with with quill i might be
alone on this but i was like oh man thor's totally trying to like gloss over everything
that's happened you know there's a lot we can deal with here but again it's based on what they do
with it because i feel like we've got the groundwork but you could fuck it or you could save it it's
really up to what they're they're not gonna i don't think they're gonna do anything with it
like i said i've been disappointed before but i've also been surprised in the next movie i
wouldn't expect thor to be like still suffering the ptsd of the events of endgame i would probably
open within being overly happy and then characters ask him about the events of what happened because
they're kind of unaware of it and then as the movie progresses you see that the demeanor he's
holding is a is just a fucking glamour basically it's james gun we trust it is james gun we'll see
but i honestly if you told me which one would you think it would do it would do the my idea or your
assumption i'd be like i think you're more on the money i don't think they're gonna do it
i fucking hope they do though just like i hope far from home is a great movie but a lot of people
are already being like uh he's gonna be good oh well maybe why people think it's not gonna be good
because a lot of people don't like homecoming so people are wrong for once i actually agree with
one day that debate will happen
what rock have you been living under that you don't know that people don't like homecoming
there are people in the chat right now who hate homecoming everybody who hates homecoming put a h
in the chat h see wait wait i can't there's no homecoming was dumb homecoming was trash cj
where have you been where have you been jay well that was two people you can always find a h
from from coming oh jesus christ all right everyone don't be shy if you thought homecoming
was underwhelming no garbage no garbage we thought it was garbage put a h in the chat because i'm
pretty sure there's a lot of those people vulture was cool though that's weird because i think it's
one of the top three in the mcu as do i i enjoyed homecoming i mean there were there were parts in it
that annoyed me but overall i enjoyed it what uh what what's the biggest only arguments i've seen
from it come from people that uh are talking about it from a purely adaptation standpoint which
sure fine but what about the objective standpoint outside um i i will completely disregard any
argument about the comics i just could not care less right i mean i i can personally totally
understand that because i mean i hate the expanse show for what it does to the books and i refuse
to watch it because of that but i'll admit to that um it won't let me put a straw poll in the
chat well wait what do you what do you what's the straw poll link me and i'll put it i did a i did a
spiderman straw poll i will i will allow people to see this was homecoming good yes or no vote now
yeah wait shad what was your main problem with uh homecoming um uh the mj replacement uh like
for me she does not come across likable at all she's this you know i'm gonna second you on that
one sir what she's she's an arrogant like fucking um self-possessed are so like i just couldn't get
behind her at all i just thought she was annoying and so she didn't i don't like her as a character
now that she's going to be the main love interest who's not even in the movie that much though
that's the problem they're setting her they're setting her up yeah we're talking about this
movie we're not talking about the next one or anything yeah yeah when she was in homecoming
she was being a jerk and so it didn't really make me like her as a character and i mean i'm a
and i guess this is the thing because you know you don't like comic book arguments but i'm a big fan
of the comic books spiderman was like my big number one i appreciate comic book arguments
but we're talking about the film separated from yeah and even separated she didn't come across as
a likable character but on top of that the fact that they replaced mary jane the true mary jane
with this i'm like what did you like seeing the trailer when peter's on a date with her
like for um far from home and he's like oh you look nice tonight and she's like what she makes
a joke out of it she makes a joke out of it imply that the only value i have is to look good and
he's like and then she says i'm kidding yeah come on no no no no i don't accept that that's a good
that's a good joke that's a joke that we would write yeah because at the end of um because you
know what someone says they're kidding but they're not really yeah see that sounded like she was
being serious you can't just fear that you can't just go oh she said she was joking but she's not
really we'll find out from the movie she did the exact same thing at the end of homecoming when
peter leaves yeah she's like where are you going what are you doing he's like oh and she goes i'm
just kidding go ahead whatever the hell are you doing he's like nah i'm just joking go on she is
though she is low-key stalking him and that's actually already proven in the in in the trailer
because she knows that he's spider-man and so that might have actually been a very genuine where the
hell are you going but then she tries to gloss over the facts yes and we could infer the opposite
of every action everyone takes i don't know it could be but but there's some validity in that
assessment based on what's happening i'm surprised that that is the major issue with homecoming when
she's barely in it well that's like it had more of an effect on me because i remember i like the
comic books and stuff and so it rubs me the wrong man like i said i liked homecoming overall but
there were certain little things that irked me and that was one of them i actually uh this is the
this is the benefit of being so detached from the comics when she's in the detention thing and he's
like why are you even here because she's not in supposed to be in detention she's drawn a picture
of the guy who's organizing detention and like she said she's got like a line under it that says
like he's pondering his purpose of his life i thought that was funny i'm not saying that's
not funny either no my point is that she's not like i i'm not comparing it to the mary jane of
the ramie films or even the comics or whatever else i she's just this character she's a character
but if there was a comparison she'd win and this is the thing if someone wait what
yeah look if someone said to me but maula what about comparing it to the comic or whatever i'd
be like well that's another conversation i'd have to read the comic and then probably agree with you
that she's a terrible adaptation but that's not what we're talking about the people answering
this dropout uh 38 of them are look okay what's the second problem if there was one uh now you
put me on the spot here well i need to think about it get back to me on it okay wait so super chat
just came in homecoming is stupid as hell because they want you to buy that a blue collar worker can
reverse engineer alien tech and not gain unwanted attention from the fbi in a day with powerful
weapons out of the streets so it took them what we can only infer was years to reverse engineer a
flying piece of gear that's all it is it's nothing more special than that and then they also have a
rifle that can disintegrate someone which is no more special than the rifles that they fucking
had in the start um the idea that they're not noticed by the fbi the whole thing is that they
only steal from people who are extremely low level and they only sell to extremely low level
even tony says that they below the avenger's grade this is all assessed in the film this is
part of why i get frustrated that people hate homecoming you're really not taking advantage
of all the effort they put into the script to explain all of the things that happen in it
one of the things i was impressed with there's there's but then it never deals with this whole
idea that like there's this weapon smuggling operation going on like we're using alien tech
to spider-man literally drops it yeah he does but against tony stark's like urging against don't
tony's you know advice but tony's recommending that they deal no tony recommended that the police
take care of it but then that's never touched upon like he never just notifies the police and
then deals with it yes he does he calls the fbi and they turn up on the ship and that's part of
why spider-man fucked up does he yes yeah this is part of why people hate this movie for no fucking
reason hang on hang on tony literally says to peter i did listen i did care he called the fbi
fucking piece it's true i'm not disagreeing with you this is what i mean i just did a great job as
peter parker i enjoyed him and there was the younger youngest peter parker we've seen which
was more true to again comic books which i love because the youngest uh the youngest aunt may
we've ever seen as well well that was that was different he's not okay so that actress is not
young by most standards she just looks incredible for her age she's young compared to that what the
fuck what was that coming from who was that coming from what's pizza
well people told me to put on elevator music so i got ice cream truck music look okay chat i apologize
for getting angry i just i constantly there's you again thinking about ice cream i constantly hear
about how homecoming sucks and i just don't like hearing references that are inaccurate that's just
i apologize sorry i did it bad i'm gonna withdraw my statement about the the police
interference then the fbi were called so that that criticism of the plot is negated but the mj is
largely unlikable it doesn't ruin the movie yeah i'll stand by that one really in it so
well this is the thing i'm not even addressing a counter argument i'm just addressing that even
if it was valid who the fuck is i'm not saying it ruined the movie for me it's a good movie
that was just one of our pet peeves i can't believe literally the fuck is dropple
40 percent of people i know incorrect people hate homecoming also some people are recommended we
check out the high top reviews video so me and fringy have actually watched it we hate it and
we're going to address it on efap eventually it's terrible high top reviews has a video explaining
why homecoming is terrible his arguments are fucking worthless and efap is gonna explain why
one day look i'm sorry but homecoming is over is underrated yeah there i said it homecoming is
underrated i said it come at me homecoming is better than the last jedi iron boy i'll give
you that one year it's better than the last jedi okay at least we can all agree on that
so uh how's everybody doing i'm doing all right how are you doing mauler not good apparently
no it's a shame people don't like the amazing movie that is spider-man homecoming
but hey if you guys do end up um having a look at people saying why it's bad
uh see if i'm available for the stream because i don't like to be on that one as well i mean dude
there are some cool elements with homecoming that i think work really well i mean i i personally
liked well this is kind of civil war related but that tony stark was the one that gave spider-man
his suit and stuff um so you like that i like that personally um because honestly a teenager
in the real world he's probably gonna have a bit of difficulty making a fancy spider-man suit that
he ends up making i know he makes in the comic books but it just addressed a small little plot
thing that you know wasn't as realistic with tony stark giving it to him uh it's also a more
realistic thing about his relationship like regarding the comic books um in in spider-man
the ultimate was so marvel had watched two different comic book universes ultimate marvel
was the next one in that in that imprint um peter parker ends up having a relationship with tony
stark and looking up to him a lot and seeing that reflected in the movie i i loved as well i thought
that was great and so there's there's a lot of cool little things like that that just gave me
yeah cool i liked it but there were things i didn't like as well so i'm wrong with that
honestly that'll be a this will be a great topic for another refab because i am so tired of hearing
about how homecoming is terrible for really bad reasons so we're definitely going to do that and
stop saying who there's everybody thinks the homecoming sucks apparently it's going to come
on for the debate though is well geeks and gamers geeks and gamers and world class bullshits both
think it's terrible and they're both big fans of spider-man as far as i understand so there'll be
plenty of stuff and we'll bring shad on as their third versus our third and we'll have a video to
respond to it'll be fucking chaos man someone in the chat asked me who cares about ultimate
spider-man look it didn't like there's a point where it goes off the rails i mean but the the
first launch of ultimate spider-man comic books that was great i loved it i loved the more kind
of bringing all the characters into a modern setting and going through all the arcs are fresh
i enjoyed it i i loved ultimate spider-man but then they killed them off so yeah it goes a bit
it's okay to be wrong sometimes we'll see we'll see i've seen a lot of maulers defending an
objectively bad movie no i mean it's like spider-man homecoming your opinion is wrong if you all
right let's just do a simple you don't have to defend it you don't have to defend it just give
a number of what you think in terms of the craftsmanship of the script
in homecoming is we'll go from left to right wolf what do you think out of 10
um i'd have to rewatch it again because i've only seen it that one time with you a few months back
but i would say like an eight rags i'd probably say an eight and a half drinker six yay nine
chad i'm gonna repeat something in chat why are we talking about spider-man because
how come we can do it
i would actually want to watch it again to be a bit more rejected when i go into a movie i actually
mostly try and turn off my nitpicky side to try and just enjoy the experience and it's
afterwards that i try and break it down but oftentimes i don't have a fresh memory of it
and so because of that yeah i'd probably want to wait before i gave it a distinct number
oh i'm saying you don't have to be committed to this so if someone said
ah you said this out of 10 and you were wrong they'd be wrong to say
because this is not a committal thing it may be eight out of 10 for me oh wow maybe seven
right i was about to say mine i'm i'm not sure if i would give it eight or eight point five i
kind of i think they're both valid or something also william crow said what's that maul is angry
because his golden goose is challenged golden goose that's civil war that's my golden goose
challenging homecoming is just something that's bothered me over time because i've never seen like
a really strong argument against it outside of it's not like the comics we don't like that mary
jane is not a white redhead which to me i'm like i understand that from an adaptation point of view
that's it and then the other comment that really fucking bothers me which is spider-man uh his life
as spider-man never interrupts his life as peter parker that's what the movie never addresses and
to me that's just utter bullshit you didn't watch the fucking film so that'll be addressed in a future
refap i suppose like i don't know if you guys would agree with that statement drinker or shad
what do you reckon i don't which statements are the same the last one the idea that spider-man
the life of spider-man never intertwines or interrupts or makes him choose between his life
as peter parker yeah that state no that statement's bullshit like in the context of the movie like
yeah he's constantly wrestling with that i think so i wouldn't i wouldn't walk up as spider-man i
it's into it's affecting his life he's i mean heck he tries to take a girl to prom and he runs
into the villa how does it not affecting his life no i would never mark down the script for that
reason so no can i just highlight the duality of youtube back to back these comments maula civil
war is an overrated film maula thanks for reminding me why i subbed to you well how can you overrate
civil war though civil war so fucking good i can't wait to make my video on that it's going
to take 10 years but it'll happen and i like the the rags liked it that made me happy because i
like rag he's a doggo yay wait shad what do you think of civil war oh i love civil war that's one
of my all-time favorites you can stay i say this tacitly but are all six of us positive about civil
war in this chat because i know that a lot of people hate civil war too yes yay it's the only
time when the avengers actually have to wrestle with real world consequences for what they do
uh high five other five people in this conversation i like that we agree
though people in chat are gonna be upset there's a lot of people who hate civil war
they're wrong there it is all right i guess i think i'm probably the only one this call that
doesn't really like civil war but not for any objective reason well um and i don't mean this
in some kind of condescending way but i'd love to watch it with you uh i can't remember if you
already did oh we already did okay fuck it let me wait for my video hopefully that'll change
something i mean my whole thing is that i was never really invested in the vast majority of
the characters in that film so i didn't really care about any of it that's here you just didn't
there wasn't any pizza in it uh i can have pizza while i'm watching the movie i've done it before
did you like infinity war because they will apparently deep fry your kebab in scotland
that's definitely the reason yes also i agree with that by the way i've tried death the kid
in chat said that uh civil war movie was better than it was in the comics changed my mind
so when i came out of civil war and i i was just like fucking hell that was good i went to see it
with a friend of mine and then a friend of his who was big into the comics and he said the reason he
hated civil war or at least didn't like it was that it separated from the comics and so we went
to mcdonald's after it and sat down and i had him explain to me exactly what the storyline in the
comics was and uh i was like that sounds much worse and he was like it doesn't matter if it's
worse they didn't do it in the films it was a poor adaptation and i was like okay fine but it sounds
much worse and basically like iron man is absolutely the bad guy in the comic vision
and uh i was just like that kind of ruins it for me because i like the idea that they're both
principled and they're both correct but they clash at the core because it's a complicated
my only criticism of civil war is that tony's motivations aren't that well defined i think
compared to caps i disagree i think like he could have done with more to to build him up to
where the sort of path that he goes down i disagree there's just not quite enough there
we can't i was about to say we can't do this we go from like a homecoming discussion to an eye
we got we got to continue with this guy's video it's taking us five hours to not get through this
how long have we actually been it's been five hours at least i love the idea that we're like
guys we're going a bit long even for efap we're going to be like we're gonna reach 10 hours soon
like this is the whole reason i started my youtube channel i love talking about media
it's the funnest thing ever that we don't have to get any we don't have to get to too serious
i love i also love talking about medea medea is a fucking glorious hero um we yeah so people
asking for like we should do we will give it time efap will cover everything it just takes us a while
the same thing with my channel anyway is everyone ready for me to press play on this video to finally
get to the end maybe nope and compared to the masterful endings tony and steve guy mauler wait
how do you feel about interstellar don't give me side people in charge be like bull's wrong on
its stellar it's a very good film oh man does anyone in this chat this is a testament to how
bad the video is it's taken us this long i don't i will jump in and say like the ending for
interstellar absolute nonsense yeah almost like the rest of the film like up until a certain point
i was all right with it but the idea that love crosses interstellar boundaries oh fuck off no
why do you hate love i didn't get that from interstellar like i'm from like you're derailing
this let's bring up interstellar at the time because i liked it yeah you well done rags you
actually managed to do it i'm from scotland love isn't what we do here
um so anyway let's carry on with this video it'll be great there's so many things to talk about
and also is just a minor slip up in the middle of his story and pretty soon he'll be back to
his full comedic self again now that he's joining the guardians but we don't know that this is the
thing he could be right he could be right the guardians plays out and thor is just a fun loving
happy dude throughout the entire film and in that case i'd be like well fucking hell endgame was just
pointless that's what they're gonna do though but they like i mean the hints were there like
right at the end of endgame when he was i have to look i'm not saying i know what they're going
to do but if they don't what what's your reaction going to be i guess i was wrong if if if it's not
that if like they go for something deeper and like it's a little bit more like i don't know
complex for him i'll be totally fine with that and it's like wow they've they've subverted my
expectation i understand why you're certain of it in the same way that i'm certain episode nine
cannot be well written but there's a very tiny chance like i don't i don't actually you know i'm
hyperbolic a lot when i say like episode nine won't be well the fact that i know that isn't
it chris terry is one of the writers and that just means your film is dead at that point
but let me let me confirm that quickly um because he's the guy who wrote batman versus superman
isn't it i can't i'll find someone posted that in the chat yeah the idea that you got first of all
jj abrams which you're fucked but to have yeah so he's the guy who wrote batman versus superman
and justice league you're fucked you're done justice league and batman versus superman the guy
he's writing it alongside jj abrams it's like there's no way but if someone said there's no way
i'd be like okay fine there's a chance it's like the the most enormous dice ever with a billion
sides and only one number on that die is going to result in a good film yeah it's possible fine
like i think it's possible for thor to have an amazing arc in guardian three
i'm not exactly going to say it's a guarantee by any stretch of the imagination but i'd hope for it
and james gunriner is a good thing i like he listed this guy as like a writer for
you know justice league wasn't there like 27 different writers i'm sorry i'm only going by
what imdb told me i could be wrong about the specifics i just mean that that's that's all i
know you wrote argo apparently people liked argo that's something oh god he's right in justice
league pot is it called justice league part two is that happening there was a second part
are you are you kidding me right as zach snyder and chris stereo oh god oh i can't wait
oh jesse eisenberg is coming back as lex luther i can't wait it'll be great who wanted that
oh dear really i can't wait to see justice league headed by aquaman and wonder woman
it's gonna be so great i want to i want to see a really fat middle-aged version of batman
i think ben aflat can deliver that quite well oh that's just the owl from watchman
so yeah so the idea that is it possible for epson nine to be well written
yes is it likely no is it possible for thord to have a great character arc as a result of guardian
three yes is it likely yeah i'd say no and that's just me being cynical i'm cynical about everything
what do you reckon marvel has a good track record they've impressed me more often than
disappointed me and so like they've taken things that you wouldn't expect to be good
and turned them great like guardians of the galaxy i don't know the the problem they have
is sustaining all these things like they can they can throw this stuff in and it's a surprise hit
the irony is like going my favorite iron man story throughout the mcu is civil war which is
what his like sixth film is it one two three avengers i think that's his sixth film i'm very
drunk uh point being that you'd be like why would you expect the sixth incarnation or at least
progression of his story to be the one that's your favorites like that's pretty unlikely so
that was a great surprise but i don't know if uh what do you what do you what does everyone reckon
on this has the mcu impressed you or disappointed you more impressed more and unimpressed
yeah impressed definitely more than disappointed i'm not sure what about you wolf i feel like i
know the answer already but go ahead impressed or disappointed more yeah which one of you felt more
with the mcu i'd say impressed more because i didn't really have much to be disappointed by
in most cases is that the if that's the case it's just that we all had a low bar i guess that makes
some but like i just didn't even have a bar i didn't have any i had a pretty high bar with some
of them like spider-man and captain america like uh because i'm a i'm a huge comic book
fan and so i had high hopes for a decent amount and the fact that they were able like iron man
i was one of the few people who knew iron man existed before the movie was made because i loved
avengers and i loved you know the comic books and the fact that they pulled these rabbits out of
hat in my mind that they were so good seeing what has been done before i was really impressed yeah
i'll give them their due like their ability to to craft a story that spans multiple movies to
tie it all together to have every movie build a little bit towards this resolution and to give
you a little bit more information about what's going on like that takes some planning that takes
some consistency and i've got to give them props for that because no other franchise that i can
think of does something like that nothing else has been so ambitious and before iron man was made
who would have ever thought that he could have been such a popular you know like central character
to a you know superhero universe like that he was almost like a b grade or even c grade
superhero no one knew who he was and then you hear a movie coming out and now his amazing like iron
man is like one of the top superheroes on the rosters now yeah the perfect actor yeah that's
what i was pretty much gonna say like robert daddy fucking heard that shit uh yeah uh funnily
enough i was actually expecting more people to say more disappointed than impressed because i
was gonna say like i was impressed by iron man disappointed by hulk disappointed by iron man
too disappointed by thor first avenger i think is pretty good actually i would actually argue it's
one of the more underrated films and most people don't talk about first avenger being any good
but um i actually think it's relatively strong and then avengers i think i loved first i love
first captain america but then iron man three is disappointing i think for me like winter soldier
is probably my favorite i like winter super hot too i really like that one um so yeah point being
was the this is this is a bad way to look at it but i was just like there's more bad than good
if you were to separate them with a line probably but uh that doesn't necessarily mean that was
impressed or disappointed whatever it's kind of an arbitrary question anyway because it's very
feeling-based i just um yeah i just expected different results i don't know either way
you guys ready for me to press play again um i believe so i think it rags it's like how do
i derail is again which movie i'm gonna i'm probably gonna round out this video and then
probably call it a night i think oh so we need a few more hours then
oh yeah wolf wolf what's your favorite
severe expectations say one of the names and then one word and then go
the fellowship of the ring
the hell no that is the wrong answer no i'd rather shoot myself than watch that again
yeah his arc is complete his story in last jedi has a sense of finality to it because the
his story is complete it's not even over he's in the next one there's no arguing that his story
is complete the argument is that it sucked hey wait can you say that though if his story
sucked would it still be complete well he's dead no one's really dead no one's really gone dude
no one's really gone is this their benchmark though it's like oh it has a sense of finality
to it because he dies like is that all you got i just like the idea that the film was
i'm not saying it's a good sense of finality like if if the film only ever showed luke on
the toilet he farts dies then he goes well in fitness it's complete the story he went through
an arc much like luke at the end of the last jedi he went out like a wet fart
heroic moment during the climax belonged to him he redeemed his failure in a story that focused
now belongs to ray lipsinger rocks yeah i was gonna say it yeah luke didn't do shit he just
stood there he was a projection he did redeem his failure like he didn't try and save kylo
yeah how is it thematically relevant that his failure begins with failing to understand his
student and mistrusting him nearly threatening to kill him and then it ends with him goading
his student into thinking he's there but he's not what's the thematic relevance there because
he's not there to save him is it literally just the fact that it involves those two characters
is that how surface level we are with this they met and talked therefore he overcame all the
problems he i i think i think with with ryan johnson he's very much about he's got an idea
in mind of like the visual of a scene and he doesn't really care what the context is to make
that happen say that as if it's like ryan johnson thing that's like a 50 of humanity thing they do
not care about the mechanics it's all about the uh the point but those those those people aren't
entrusted to write like a billion dollar you know script for you know no they think what ryan
did was a masterpiece but he you know he had this idea of like you know luke and kylo facing off
in this desolate wasteland with the sun setting behind them and everything like that the showdown
at sunset and he didn't care how it had to come about he just made it happen
and he wanted to surprise revelation about what the nature of that confrontation was and it was
just oh yeah guess what luke's not there and it's all a mirage but then he's dead anyway because i
need to get rid of him in this script that's all he wanted why do you want me to be hateful
you're reminding me of all this stuff to me
hey rags what's your favorite video game and why
and he did now now well we can't be derailing this all the time we have to stay focused
dragon stong left just saying oh metroid
dragon stong or in the plan yeah they're in a story that focused on his redemption
thor was a side character thrown into endgame to make fat jokes and kind of redeemed later on
but with no real dramatic weight how can you say kind of redeemed while simultaneously arguing
that he was never redeemed in this video what does that mean because those fat jokes were hilarious
of a video essay this this is going to tie into this whole idea that people have of like well
you don't like the last jedi because you don't understand it because you're not
smart enough to take it all in give a thought that maybe that's the truth well it's kind of
like if i if i go and order a burger and someone gives me a shit on a bun and and and i complain
about it and they're like well it's because you don't understand the turd it's supposed to represent
your failure to understand the the the the the damage that you're doing to your body by eating
the burger or pretty much but this is it like you can come up with any kind of argument like that
like well if you don't like something it's because you don't understand it it's like well have you
ever considered the prospect that like it's actually not that smart at all in fact it's the
opposite of smart it's the ying to smart yang it's it's an enemy to screen it's a dumb as fuck
screenplay written by a dumb as fuck writer to try and satisfy like a bunch of like idiotic
requirements and that's all it is thrown in the end game to make fat jokes and kind of redeemed
later on but with no real dramatic weight attached to his journey it feels juvenile while luke's
story feels mature and poetic it's like poetry and rhymes yeah i don't know poetic in the same
way that uh my immortal is no i'm trying to claim since that free verse is poetic when it's just
bullshit if i'm trying to um give the guy as much benefit as i can look for story arc is lighter
because it has humor in it that doesn't make it worse though because the fun the humor was fun
there was it was good and it didn't necessarily rob what he was going through either because he
was kind of using his carefree attitude as a as a way to mask what is really dealing with
i don't necessarily agree about that with every one of the jokes the one that seriously bothers me
is the cheese was one when he's trying to explain that he needs to be the one that brings everyone
back and fucking machine just makes that joke yeah like that wasn't not a good place to put
that joke the one where he says i think he's dead i didn't mind that one that was fun and you know
he looks like uh he looks like melted ice cream i chuckled at that and the bit the bit that pissed
me off is when he has to speak to jane and he has a panic attack because he can't face up to it
like does that really seem like the kind of thing that thor would do after everything he's been
through all right well what about what about looking at this way right thor can be he's always
been kind of vain he's the strongest avenger he wants to be epic and all these things and he's
now gone into the past where he looks like melted ice cream he like i think there's some validity
saying that he might be overly self-conscious appearing to his mum and jane in the state that
is in he knows is a mess what because he's fat as shit yeah like jane has this idea and the real
four is there of him being this absolute hero you know god-like figure and now he's looking
like the big lebowski i don't know man it seems like a reach it could be a reach but is it a is
it a potentially valid way of looking at it that he would have negative body image and that would
be his thing that like brings well not only that he like there's a lot of implications about it if
he's supposed to be this epic powerful hero and has let himself get into that state what does that
say about his character and where he's at i mean it's so it's more than just having a negative body
image but the problem we have later is like we see that that that his physical appearance doesn't
really have any impact on his like what he can do like he can still you know have his hammer and his
his axe in both hands and he can still like conjure lightning and he can still take on
Thanos on equal terms like he's not been diminished by the fact that he's fat
so it doesn't it kind of doesn't really amount to anything it's just a cosmetic thing really
and it makes that just reinforces my opinion that it's it's there for for laughs it's like oh let's
laugh at Thor because he's fat now where where do you take that sorry i got a crying pig in the
background i got a view i was listening anyway that's my that's my rant when it comes to fat
Thor i was just interested to hear the both of you change ideas i've got nothing to add i don't know
no jay i interrupt with some awkward comment
let's yeah i'm still i'm gonna i'm gonna interrupt with the idea that it's actually
starting to get light here where i am i can see it my window i mean yeah was it was it
light when we started yeah
what a poetic arc that's a great art no matter what the context is
oh everyone just decided to stop talking i think they're good to keep going on the video yes
this is this video i feel so bad if the person who uploaded this ever watches this he'd be like
you barely talk about my video to his journey it feels sorry your video so sure he feels mature
and poetic thor is also not the focus when he could have gotten equal focus to tony and steve
i know that's not the case since we'll see more of him but again dealing with the repercussions of
Thanos was kind of a major thing for his character but that might be to come another thing it's not
it's not you can only say it might not this is the i completely understand your apprehension
with the concept because i think that i would be on your team if this was in another scenario
if i was a bit more cynical about it but i actually do think they have plans for thor
and that this was iron man and caps movie yeah like because there's only so many characters
that they can give time to because there are heaps in there and so it does make sense if
captain america and iron man are moving on you really need to wrap it up in that in this movie
right now but thor is sticking around you do you have time to keep going with it but then what can
you do because well i was suggestion but but he's now achieved his his aim like he's put right the
thing that he failed on danos is now dead everyone who died has been restored and everything is fine
now pretty much well maybe fannis was just the character that instigates the problem the problem
is something he still needs to address which is that he couldn't save the world and he's just
tried to ignore it by the fact that he tried to work with them to defeat the post-hoc problem
which is the new thanos trying to uh kill everybody again still dealt with that this is
what i mean like the it's complex so this is why i like that episode nine is finally coming out
so that we can finally to be definitive about a lot of things so the idea that you try and criticize
tfa the snokes backstory not existing people will be like yeah but that's the point of tlj
is there's gonna bring in snokes backstory and it's like no he's dead there is no backstory like
no they're gonna bring his backstory in in episode nine it's like fucking hell guys really
but then they still could they absolutely could they won't but they absolutely could
so the fact that episode nine is coming out is a relief because we get the answers in concrete
what what what these characters are who they who they are what they mean um the thing is we know
for a fact that chris hamsworth is willing to go on while uh ap and iron man wanted to go out and
they did go out we'll have to see yeah well i think but i i i probably will agree with you
i probably will agree with you because i like i said i think it's much more likely that they'll
fuck thor's character up rather than fix which is what they can do going forward from endgame just
like when going forward from tfa yeah and to try to try and equate this with episode nine i don't
think we're going to find out anything about who anyone is it's not going to be consistent with
anything we've seen so far no yeah there's clearly no plan there there's no overarching story to this
it's just well what about this what can we do even if jj had a plan which nobody would believe but
let's just say he did ryan johnson threw it away and went his own direction so imagine
having a plan for three films someone else did film two and it's the complete opposite of what
you intended imagine trying to write film three as the guy who had the plan from film one yep you
fucked yeah i just i honestly just get rid of last jedi pretend it doesn't exist but then who do you
blame for all this ultimately disney you have no choice but like pin it pin it down to someone
specific like someone over oversaw this and someone approved it you know we had
jj starting it off with the force awakens and then just basically handing over the reins
to ryan johnson saying do whatever the fuck you want with it don't mind and then he did
and what he did was awful but then is that ryan johnson's fault is it like kathleen kennedy's
fault for approving it a lot of people blame kathleen kennedy is it jj abram's fault for
saying like yeah you can do whatever you want i don't mind this is my outline but you can use
it or not i don't know that he necessarily had a choice in that anyway and uh let's remember that
if you were like why didn't you complain about where the direction of episode eight when it's
like i don't think he can contractually do that probably some claws that's like you will not
disparage where this blah blah blah goes not that i think that he would i'm sure that he would just
be on board with anyway because he recently signed a deal where he got was it half a billion dollars
or something uh for a bad robot something like that yeah and he to work with warner brothers
i think it was and it's just like when you read that you're like whoa he just he just got 500
million dollars he could totally be at the point where he's selling his soul
but you just think like for for something with so much money behind it and so much at stake
the idea that you can just run roughshod over whatever plans there were before it's just
mind-boggling like it's to subvert expectations which yeah you can't just have anybody out there
subverting expectations i mean doing the obvious the thing that the fans want that would actually
make a good movie that's just ridiculous so anyway okay since we'll see more of him but again
dealing with the repercussions of thanos was kind of a major thing for his character
but i guess it really wasn't in the grand scheme of things now look i really hate last jedi i'd
probably rather rewatch attack of the clone since it's at least way funnier and meme filled
but last jedi is not the worst movie ever made and i have to give credit where i see it
luke's emotional journey i'm afraid you've given credit where it didn't deserve it
it's not the worst movie ever made what high praise i don't understand why people even say
that i mean i've probably said it to be honest it's not the worst movie ever
but the room is so bad it's good yeah trad said's being bad hey you can't use the word bad
in conjunction with the room there's only good there's only masterpieces
it's a masterpiece so could the last jedi be one of the worst movies in the world
it's one of the worst yes i would say that i think terminator genesis is worse
yeah like i can think of movies i'd consider worse so well yeah most people go to b movies
that are really poorly made in every single direction possible including writing as opposed
to hollywood movies that are typically only badly done in terms of writing because mostly
because they're hiring well-known actors they hire cgi artists that are good at their jobs they hire
people to do cinematography for them like all these things are usually just they come with the
price but apparently you can't buy good writing like you can't buy a surely good writer and i
think that's also tied to the fact we have time limits you think you could all right well yeah
time limits can affect this is the thing man it's like a lot of us feel that we could write a good
tlj but what if someone said do it in an hour we'd be like fuck yeah and you might be like we
still do better than ryan johnson i agree with that
you know what i mean though like a lot of writers will suffer dramatically when they're forced to
write something quickly um because that's not the way you're supposed to do writing but it's not
taken as seriously as it should be in hollywood as far as i can tell it's a shame i like the
writing part of movies it's kind of what i base my channel after it's kind of one of the fundamental
things that makes a good movie in my mind unless it's like some faster than furious just fun bull
crap when i get to get to see cars explode but even then they're still telling a story
the hobbs and shaw trailer that looks great it does i actually when i saw the trailer with a
friend of mine we were watching i think it was captain marvel i was like you know that looks
like a lot of fun to just watch when you literally aren't paying attention when uh me and my friend
went to go see dark phoenix the uh trailer came on and when the rock was holding on to a
trying to like keep them together over a cliff this reminds me of not possibly taken seriously
that was hilarious well the thing is the previous fast the viewers didn't they have a race against
a submarine in the ad tactic wasn't that a thing i stopped paying attention to the fast the furious
franchise it's like the dumbest set of movies ever created that's the only time where i've seen
someone grab a torpedo when it jumps above the ice and just like redirect it towards something
they wanted to blow up like yeah it's beautiful that's where you're wrong that's completely
realistic and well written when you when you're the rock you can do things like that
anyway not the worst movie ever made and i have to give credit where i see it luke's emotional
journey was really compelling no could have been but it fell short how the fuck can't you just say
luke's story could have been compelling but it fell short how can't anyone just say that
and it really seems like he's like as he said before luke's one felt serious and thors one felt
like a joke but like the humor in thors journey doesn't undermine the stuff is going through
and like if you were to say which one felt more serious well i would say it would be the last
jedi one but the writing was awful the motivations were terrible he was contradicting his character
as a mess i mean it seems like he would actually admit to judging it ignoring the fact that it's
bad at the premise the luke one like i'm not even trying to criticize him here i think that that's
the premise for this analysis felt more legitimate because it was serious and that seems like what
he's basing his judgment on really compelling thors could have been but it fell short sometimes
it's important to let go of our hate and recognize when a bad movie does something better than a good
movie this is not really i don't think that's what you did here just because a movie has a serious
like tone doesn't actually make its content serious yeah i agree with that that's a lot of
people upon first viewing of the last jedi said that the comedy was so misplaced so many of the
jokes in the last jedi felt awkward like ooh making a joke okay i thought we were being serious
but okay the idea that like it's a mutually understood thing that this is a mature film it's
like no but it fell short sometimes it's important to let go of our hate and recognize when a bad
movie does something better than a good movie there you go i brought balance to the force by
talking positively about the last jedi for a change perfectly balanced now that i've said both
good and bad things about it i'm sure the comment section will be perfectly content
well maybe i don't know i'm assuming that the video is relatively well was
wet well received compared to the the doom video for example you know at least i tried
i never got to finish the doom video how'd that go horribly the guy came on rags the guy came on
he did yep how'd that go about as well except you he was a friend leo yeah he he
don't know where gaming is no he he came on he was like what are you guys doing with your new
fangled computers you should go back well i was about to say you could go back and look at it but
it's currently fucking held up by warner brothers you'll have to wait for that he seemed familiar
with you and he made it sound like you two had some altercation at some point did he i thought
he just made it sound like he knew who rags was that's all oh i don't know there's something in
this tone of voice that made me is there something that happened between these two at some point
they fucked i wasn't thinking that but i mean that's easily something that could have happened
oh either way we defeated that video it only took us 11 hours
and with that fellas i'm gonna need again let's get let's get let's get plugs done all right
in case people are leaving all right so shad talk about your channel you wonderful man
swords castles how it integrates with pop culture and fantasy and all that fun good stuff and i'm
gonna show my book because it's coming out tomorrow i wrote a book that's good go buy it
that's it come on man you gotta you gotta tell him it's the only book that's worth buying in the
universe what's it about it's about it's about pages the former tyrannical emperor of a fantasy
world when he sits down on a road towards redemption for who better to fight back the
darkness in the world than the one responsible for most of it there you go there's there's a bitch
fireman yeah why are we talking about that when spider-man's coming out how do you how do you know
that meme how did this spread this a little bit repeated in the channel i might know far more than
people might realize i'm impressed shad is an efap scholar oh yeah everyone should subscribe to
shadow diversity to learn about why swords are bad in media that's what you do right
and when the swords are good but also just fantasy tropes and also but i also did random
things on sci-fi i did a review of the last jedi and how i hated it and uh and so there's a random
movie review on occasionally and i said but the mainstay is like what movie in the in the mainstream
would you say is one of the best representations of how medieval tech slash uh vehicles slash
accurate armor clothing weapons and stuff yeah just accuracy i guess outlaw king the recent one
on netflix was surprisingly well done i like it impressed me on so many levels there were some
inaccuracies i did video reviews but the weapons and armor were mostly full on legit very like i
was amazed yeah so outlaw king there you go the rubber the bruce one yep that's the one yeah they
filmed that like half a mile from ha ha nice nice oh there you go all right my kids are getting
ready i gotta go fellas thanks have a good day sir we'll have you back at some point for sure
i'm assuming critical drinker would you like to escape now or yeah because i'm gonna have to get
up in like three hours to go well then tell people about your amazing channel and why they
should subscribe you shouldn't i'm an asshole don't subscribe to no don't say that don't say
oh yeah like yeah i'm really good do fascinating work uh i'm probably going to talk about cobra kai
next because i fucking love that show and i've been meaning to talk about it for ages
and it's very rare that i actually cover something positive that i enjoy so that's my next thing
the drinker recommends you watch cobra kai
i haven't actually seen it i don't know if anyone else here has but i've only heard good things
it is is very good also it made me laugh on multiple occasions you stayed for like how long
has this been what was the first half was it hours how long how long i don't know it's all
gone into a big blur for me start at seven ish yeah we're nearly at four means we're nearly at
eight hours yeah i said to you like when we started this like don't worry i'll be around
till about midnight at least and yeah four hours over that is a little bit yeah like when there's
things that i want to rant about and there's things that piss me off well i just gotta keep
going i suppose nine hours is what we're nearly at now nine hours not bad that is a fucking long
efap wow not the longest still though it's the longest 11 hour efap we might be that today because
it usually takes people the two hours to get some super chairs episode 50 is going to be the 24
if if there is some other stuff that you want to cover um yeah do let me know and i'll drink
absolutely have you back sir it was fantastic and i hope you have a good sleep for three hours
thank you it's uh it's been emotional good night slash morning uh see you later guys bye see ya
so is is anyone else leaving or the four of us staying i i have to be up pretty early tomorrow
so i think i'm gonna have to call it a night here very well i was gonna say plug but i mean you're
like the guy who's always around and stuff so yeah don't subscribe to me don't watch my terrible
videos or my terror i never do anything good so he even cuts out when he's trying to tell you not
what to do so yeah so don't watch anything or do anything related to me because i'm terrible and
i bring down efap and i'm the worst one here bye everybody yeah i am oh wait yeah what if there
let me just make sure there's no new bayouin drawing for you
a lot of people saying the thing got copyrighted no oh no no no no and you're good okay
okay we'll see the bayouin thing next time mm-hmm all right i'll see you guys
and that leaves jay raggers and mules lee to attack the chat
yes there's there's a lot this is over eight hours i guess a lot of several one dollar ones that
have questions so we'll start my favorite is the first one is from a user called shrek 2 and there's
no message it's like what is rags your back rags yay yay i don't know if you can tell this
efap has just killed me i don't know if i'm acting different or not in fairness i'm just dead i think
there'll be there may be comments about how there was either interruptions or people not speaking
much but there was six six people very hard to make that balanced you know
especially when you have like a person saying two plus two is five and you have six people
rearing to respond to that you just get blue all at the same time but hopefully we managed it to
the point of it being at least entertaining yeah but yeah uh all right next one james more rags
another profile picture how many do you have ten trillion ten trillion there's the answer by the
way howdy everyone hello we did it guys efap 40 all hail the toxic brood all hail don second
all hail don and then here's another donation from the profile shrek 2 with nothing to say
shrek 2 electric boogaloo shrek 2 good to see you boys back the don is pleased
yes hashtag maranda cozgrove for captain marvel anyone know who maranda cozgrove is
okay is she an actress time to be what has she been in she's been in
despicable me too i cali's tv show i guess school of rock oh was she the girl
credentials all right i mean i don't i don't mind i think anybody might be an improvement over
over cheese what was it cheese theft that was it cheese left fucking i'll do it i'll play captain
marvel fuck it uh from creamy sheath from creamy sheath uh you guys seen cinema sins captain
marvel vid i think the only reason might have is sin okay so what do you think jack it was really
really bad like cinnamon sins no cinnamon wins no wait oh wait sorry one point where he
goes um where he talks about how it's really great that two women have a conversation in the mcu
so clarification the creamy sheath's question was apparently about cinema sins not wins
has anyone seen the cinema cinema sins video i haven't seen it that was what i was talking
about oh okay i thought you were talking okay um wait so cinema sins said that it's great the
two women have a conversation two women have a conversation and they're not they're not bad
characters which they are but one of them is but i thought the whole thing was about him criticizing
the film he says that's a good thing yeah but sometimes he takes sins off and it's like oh
it's like you know it's about time two women had a conversation in the mcu and
tried to think of times is it supposed to be like a joke or is it for realsies no it was for reals
like um it's about time two strong female characters had a conversation in the mcu
and i tried desperately to think of another time that two strong female characters had a conversation
d but couldn't so never mind i guess it comes down to what you consider to be a strong female
character well who what what other woman conversations are there in the mcu
um i guess i'd have to go film by film and then recant myself with them like for example
the first one i immediately think of is when the girl who's trying to prove that tony stark's a
bad person who ends up sleeping with him talks to pep pots that's probably the earliest two girls
talking to each other seen in iron man i think right yes and i know i don't know if you call
either of them strong female characters that's fine with me but one of them is hell bent on
proving that iron man is a phony and the other one works for him who turns out to be a hero
himself i don't know i think there's an argument to be um yes someone in chats highlighted gamora
nebula have spoken to each other that's the thing oh yeah oh yeah there we go i don't know um
interesting conversation i suppose hmm uh but yeah what about because what about cinema wins
this video have you seen that no it's only part one that's the part that blows me away
oh hey solar sands is in the chat i've watched your videos
solar sands solar sands but like s-a-n-s or s-a-n-d-s s-a-n-d-s sand desert sands
some words you have to say in american for them to understand jay
you just have to pronunciate better pronunciate even your english language englando that's what
you're supposed to say um what does solar sands do jay uh the videos uh of his live scene are the
ones where he all right if i'm thinking if i'm thinking of the right channel if i'm hmm
you know you love his videos but you can't remember who he is i've said i've seen the videos
yeah i would if i was really excited you seemed really excited i like solar sands i would be
extremely offended and i would announce jay if i if i was solar sands kick jay yeah i would
didn't i would announce that jay needs to be yeah good job jay good job uh efap gaming left for dead
when also you're awesome that is honestly the placeholder for the next efap gaming it's just
that uh we don't necessarily plan these things out it'll happen but uh we like playing left for dead
so that'll probably happen for sure maybe definitely hello gentlemen hello chip chiply how
would you do hello oh god went to galaxy's edge at best a c as part of dl also wonder how quinton
feels for saying milkshakes are okay now what has happened to andy nyo do you know how to pronounce
that properly ngo nyo yeah okay so for anyone who doesn't know they have apparently upgraded
their milkshakes to involve quick drying cement which is which is very scary because that shit
getting in your eyes can cause you major issues uh so the idea that people like lol milkshakes
are okay is now is though controversial because like are you sure it's almost like the thing that
was obviously going to happen that we said was happened happened very quickly yeah and this is
the thing you might be like oh you're taking a political side with this like i'm against violence
as a whole how about you just don't assault people uh and you might be like how the fuck
is throwing a milkshake at someone violence it's like i don't know it's hitting them with an object
yeah like i think that's fair to to qualify itself as violence i think most people would agree with
that don't throw milkshakes at people also don't throw acid at people also don't throw quick drying
cement at people i think that we can all agree on that at this point right the good don't throw at
people yeah don't throw things at people you don't like unless it's like confetti or or it
prevents them from fucking killing somebody at that point maybe do it oh yeah that's okay
let's be reasonable uh yeah not a good sign also uh as for galaxy's edge if they ask you to smile
it's okay well now hold on well now jay you say that but you're a privileged white male who
doesn't have to deal with the impression that interstellar galactic gods have to deal with
but i said it is okay damn wow uh and as for galaxy's edge i don't know anything about it
outside of it being an attraction to do with star wars that uh didn't perform as well as they wanted
question mark that's really meh yeah i honestly don't know enough about it for the drinks machines
they have have got all the names of the names of what the names of the different drinks are
written in arabesh what oh um if you type in galaxy's edge the first story that pops up is
why is galaxy's edge so empty a few reasons it's bad right uh happy fourth of dawn everybody
happy fourth of dawn
well is it the fourth efap after dawn was incepted that could be it that's probably it
thank you uh maula please say zerwarudo zerwarudo that means but thanks love you yes thank you
hey maula i went back and played soma a few more times the last few weeks thanks for doing the
series on soma and amnesia regarding horror content have you watched the film lake mundo
and cube i've seen cube i haven't seen lake mundo i quite like the idea of cube
i watched cube two it was a little bit disappointing but um yeah i don't know i'm
always interested in the idea that people have been kidnapped and they wake up in a mysterious
circumstance that is almost supernatural and they have to work together to defeat it and they end up
getting killed one by one who doesn't love that premise
see nobody denied it so everyone loves it that's how i um
um oh shit the drinker is here yo critical drinker one vodka bottle in two more to go just
for you back to drinking this is it he would have appreciated that had he been able to stay for these
all right i'll listen to i'll listen to this throughout the week yeah people have been saying
they really want an efap i was like well let's be good for uh anybody who needs we're up to nine
hours i think right now is it six and a half plus two so it's eight and a half are we going to beat
the uh 11 hour record we might it depends on how many of these super chats are like questions and
stuff for example uh can't wait for more nazi vampires rags uh we might be doing an episode
tomorrow uh because zargon isn't going to be able to be here wednesday maybe the fuck is nazi
vampires you haven't told me about this oh yeah i'm we're doing uh i'm doing a campaign on arch
warhammers channel uh like a vampire the masquerade uh where we're we're nazi vampires don't you know
that's racist yes subscribe to but we're soldiering on anyway uh well if you'll do it because it's our
coverage i think that was in reference to covering the doom video maybe talking about harris
promoting terrorism against oh they wanted us to talk about harris promoting terrorism against
uh neo i i always feel like i'm pronouncing that wrong uh so as far as i know h bomber guy put out
a tweet saying like stop complaining that they're throwing milkshakes at you like sort of thing and
then once he found out that they'd beaten the shit out of him he did eventually say that that's a bad
and you couldn't do that it was in sitch's video like um h bomber guy was an asshole
for not recognizing the potential flaws but he did end up saying like yeah okay this is bad
this shouldn't happen what has happened so i don't want to say that he has no fucking humanity at all
because he does acknowledge that you got a tiny shred eventually after people start getting you
know since an er it'll come out in a tiny way i just why can't we just revere it all the way
back to don't assault people why can't we just stick there no matter what you know because we
have to bash the fash and if the fash happens to be gay asians then well damn it throw bricks at him
did you guys know that don now plays guitar for judas priest he changed his name to andy
sneepe so the villainous captain marvel can't find him don't tell us she might know yeah i was
gonna say what the fuck you're revealing it stop it's a secret rags play an amazing game called
fallout 76 royale um that's gonna be a it's gonna be a maybe for me dog everyone's gonna want you to
cover it after it's gonna be amazing battle royale is it already out i actually don't have
no idea maybe somebody in chat does we'll keep an eye on it uh would you be willing to add ben down
from play the game and hurt records to your ever growing list of potential guests i have no idea
who that is or what those programs are so uh all i'll say is that we're open to any guest pretty
much so maybe uh would you be interested in hearing you discuss oh would be interested in hearing you
discuss will building and storytelling with him again sure uh we're really not against any potential
guest the sad fact of efap is that it's usually once per week and we have a bazillion guests we
want to get on and so eventually and people to get on again for example we've had uh we need to get
pipeman and cynic snacks on for their repeat viewings you know because we've had cj twice
go to get the two other members of the great british podcasts on again otherwise this is just
an evil we're bad people if we don't that'll be sort of it you have uh gonna have goliath on soon
oh absolutely he's very desperate apparently we've misrepresented him that's what he made a video
about it he was very upset i i don't know what that he's gonna actually he's gonna have to take
that up with cynic snacks because he's the one who is yeah yeah so uh efap is live oh cool i'm
awake for this eat doom eternal looks terrible grabs bfg right where is he i mean honestly and
this is this is me being very as much as generous i can be the guy seemed to say that he would have
uh he wanted to re revise his video um and that a lot of his points weren't necessarily as as
expanded as he wanted them to be but he said he enjoyed uh what he heard of efap so that's good
he really liked bayouin's art as well again yay i love the idea that we're adding uh people
to our list of potential enemies turned friendlies we're adding are we adding members to the toxic
brood yes it expands uh this better be long i need something to listen to at work tomorrow see
that's the sad thing it is long but you won't be able to listen to it as long as it's blocked
it's gonna be blocked for at least a month it is bad yeah it's it's bad according to the youtube
algorithm a it's gonna be really depressing if this thing doesn't get unblocked and i can't
download it because that means that i'm gonna we're gonna be doing the next efap before i can
even get this one out which if it's blocked you you can still play it for yourself you can record
your screen and play it okay we'll we'll figure something out guys don't panic okay we'll figure
don't panic everybody how does doom look terrible i'm legitimately curious it looks
like game of the year material like its previous game well you you found out oh it was very
satisfying answer was it not chugging a beer in honor of the critical drinker and clicking on
this stream within the first five minutes of uploading well he drank a lot and so did i it
was wonderful it was very I only had one beer i i brought it back with me i brought a beer back
with me to drink for efap because i don't i don't have any here with me at the house right now you
should always have a backup spirit in your house rags i do it's in the freezer but i don't want to
climb up there freezer yeah hang on what hang on you keep your spirits in the freezer and your
your freezer is up somewhere yeah the freezer is up of the top part of the i will admit really tall
yeah what i've found watching a lot of american media is their freezes are typically above the
fridge rather than below what the fuck i know yeah yeah we don't do that that way we we don't
live like savages the freezer we don't have to the fridge and it's below the fridge
ours is about half the size of the fridge too and it's above
we don't we i think i i don't think we access our freezer as much as the fridge so we want
see the reason the freezer okay so here's the thing about that uh you know there's a there's
a separator between the freezer and the fridge right so it doesn't matter if heat goes up
especially if the whole thing i would argue from that side is the same temperature basically
so when you put the freezer below the fridge it pushes the fridge to be at standing level with
you and that's why it's useful because you typically access the fridge far more than the
freezer so you'd kneel for the freezer while you would stand for the fridge but if you do it the
american way stand for the fridge here yeah well you might not depending on the sizes
i guess if you're really tall i am six foot five sir okay so regs you keep your spirits
in your freezer why they don't freeze what i have in there right now is um wild turkey
uh that's not an actual drink that's an animal no it is yeah wild turkey wild turkey i haven't
had i haven't had a turkey in my freezer for a long time oh my god wild turkey is an actual
drink what the fuck is wrong with you people yeah it's really good it's uh wild turkey american
honey is what i really like it's really smooth do you like cook a turkey to the degrees that
it turns into a liquid is that how that works what yeah that's why it's brown ew once you
squeeze once you squeeze down a turkey turn it into just something but sure that's not just its
pee like no no no no no no that ain't no turkey pee you squeeze the turkey down into a liquid
and then you add alcohol to it and then just just squirt it into a bottle and then you freeze it
and then you enjoy it at holidays and special occasions i'd love to try it if ever i get to
visit your eggs it's actually really good i really like it because it's very smooth and i don't like
strong spirits why i enjoy it well because it doesn't freeze oh it's in the freezer it doesn't
freeze mark alcatraz said molar is so stupid that feel when you take me seriously when i ask if
if it's made from a real end yes he really thought that what we do here in america
is we go out to the woods and catch wild animals there's people telling me i'm wrong about how it's
fucking hell check come on uh you can't kill just men brie and then brie responds is that
a personal attack or something i think that's in response to a theoretical filming of that
deleted scene where she actually basically confirms that she's we should kill the dawn
i think that'll be reasonable and they're like brie brie brie brie brie we can't kill him
we're killing dogs cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese uh can't wait for abrams to recreate the
dark night when i saw it in theaters it was all practical and real and you knew it and that's what
batman is real does abrams have any connection to batman right now i don't i don't man isn't real
yes he is he's in gotham wolf wolf is batman i'd like to talk about it oh you should probably
you know what's nice by the way despite the fact that the first part of this efab has been
obliterated the second part won't be because there's barely anything to be claimed by anybody
so you have this half didn't you say there were more memes to look at oh we looked at them there's
only there's one more meme video that we can check out but i might save it now because wolf's not here
and i like wolfson give me a second wolf and rags to be here for me i'm here yeah but wolf isn't
and i save memes one out of two is pretty fucking good as the manager i say it's okay you can't no
yeah i'm gonna be like just show everybody comes back no okay we wait for wolf i don't even remember
how that meme started no i don't either how you became manager but you did there's several memes
where you're the manager so you have to own it take my money thanks for hours of entertainment
no problem tom hooray uh binge watch joseph anderson just to feel pissed off my god he's
aids tier mauler please bore him again oh uh we can't really cover joseph unless he does like a
concept video if he's doing a review of a game it has to be the me wolf and rags are aware enough
of the game to be able to prove him wrong and he has to actually be wrong about the game but if he
does something in concept like let me tell you why the horror genre sucks we could absolutely rip
him apart but it's going to be a lot that had never happened before i don't think when he
actually made that video so i'll have to wait until he does that again or it's a game that
we've all played which is again relatively unlikely i think yeah he's an interesting fellow i might end
up doing his uh his subnautica video because do it i'm gonna watch it and then maybe do it do it
uh movie binge update finally watched the lord of the rings again after eight years and i bored like
a f-a-g he has to separate it out because you know at the end of the return of the king good to
know i still have feelings also no country for old men is fantastic k bye jay hasn't yeah it is
jay hasn't i haven't no wait i have i have i've just remembered i have you have seen that i have
actually wow a long time ago though are you gonna develop that what did you think jay tell the
audience i barely remember it it did not affect me very much i like that it's like no guys jay did
see it you're like oh great what did you think i don't remember oh well no country for old men is
awesome uh if you couldn't prove a film show or game is objectively bad are you entitled to a
refund well the entitlement to a refund changes based on what country you're in and what laws
there are right that's like the only thing that entitles you to a refund i don't know if you're
talking about morally or legally because again morally would just be basically down to every
person's definition of what should entitle you to a refund but um typically and rags you can answer
this in america isn't it like are you entitled to a refund essentially if you think that you've been
treated awfully and argue it relatively soundly i know that that's pretty much how it works in
britain what for what product so let's say you're in a restaurant and you get given a perfectly fine
meal by any standard but you gag on it and throw it up and then you go this was disgusting i demand
a refund is it likely you'd get a refund for it um generally in restaurants since that's a
fairly uncommon thing for most normal people to do you probably will uh because they want you to
come back essentially so and yeah i don't think you're owed one i don't think legally yeah no
that's the thing morally and legally you might not be but uh so my experience in the toy story worked
in for a while uh they told us and this is this is the big shame of retail they told us that once
the customer makes enough noise shut them up by giving them a refund and that's really bad as a
precedent because it just encourages people to be fucking loud oh fucking hell they can do whatever
they want i don't work in retail anymore but please for the god remember that there are people
that work behind those registers people okay they could be you the ones i actually recommend everyone
working a tough retail job before doing anything in life just so you can be humbled by the fact
that it's fucking horrible to work in a really rough retail job yeah retail can be rough service
industries can they have their moments i used to i worked in retail for three hours does that count
i used to uh so when i used to run the twitch stream before i did any youtube reviews
and there used to be a meme on my stream that whenever i ran it because it used to be between
one and four hours uh for every other day and so my fans would be like have you any got any more
work stories i used to have loads of work stories i have a favorite that i feel like i should
probably not tell because we've got loads of super chats right now but i mean i we're pretty
long on efap right so it wouldn't matter man bad i'm curious now so you guys know um what are they
called fuck wrap it up already get to the point the funko pop dolls right yes i do so we had a
i was in charge of the software department and for some fucking reason they gave us the funko pops
because i guess they're connected to media and software is typically a lot of media so we had to
take charge of them we had this huge stand to them and uh we also had a security guard because
every store should have a security guard that sense we actually got him installed because someone
tried to run away with a ps4 and our manager had to tackle them it was the most fucking hilarious
thing you've ever seen um we got a security guard and so these these this couple came up to to my
till because i was in charge of software i had only been working there for three months and i was put
in charge you're in charge of like the software department yeah which is the most like it was
ridiculous it was a really really really really bad situation i tried to be vague about it because
i don't want to put anyone in trouble but it was terrible i shouldn't have been in charge
but i was the best person to be put in charge because of how bad the turnover was there so
i was just doing my dailies and then i saw these this couple come up to the stand with um all the
funko pops and they just start taking them all out onto the floor and like the entire stand and i
was just looking i'm like okay that's odd behavior the idea i'm talking like a hundred of funko pops
they're just putting them all on the floor and the security guard looks at them and he looks at me
and he looks back at them and he's just like you know like mouths what the fuck are they doing and
i just shrug my shoulders like i don't know and they're just staring at them they're looking back
looking through them all and he walks up to them and he's like uh what are you doing and like i'm
in range so i can hear the conversation and then they're like oh we're just looking through them
because they're we're just looking for the ones we want and he was like okay people walk through
here so if you wouldn't mind like you know doing this in a more efficient manner if you have to do
this this way whatever you know it's sort of thing and they put them all back but then like the woman
out of the it's at least a guy and a girl woman's like distressed about this and i remember finding
the odd but i just go back to my my work whatever and then fast forward about 20 minutes and my
manager comes up to me and she was like i need to speak to you about our security guard and i was
like okay and uh the couple and my manager come up to me and they're like uh so these these people
feel very distressed were they harassed by the security guard and i was like um and they were
like you were there you heard what he said i was like so uh you uh you guys were looking at the um
the funko pops right and they're like yeah do you remember what he said oh well he said he said that
he wanted to know what you were doing right and they were like no i was like oh sorry what what
did he say you're like he was like are you trying to rob the store are you trying to sneakily put
these into your clothing and he was like oh i need to check what you're doing i was like oh
i don't um i don't remember uh him saying that and then like uh they started talking more and
then i got the manager talked to me separately and she was like i think these people are crazy
like what actually happened and i was like he literally just asked what they were doing
and that was it and she was like yeah that's what the security guard told me and then they
came over as we were talking they were like i demand he be fired i demand he be fired and we
were both like wide-eyed like uh i don't think that's how it works i don't think you can just
fire something the customer does not have the power to hire and fire actually and ironically
she was like we will never shop here again unless he's fired and my manager was like okay
that seems like a win-win right and uh yeah well they like they left outrage the security guard
was like hey man thanks for backing me up i was like what do you mean i did i did i just told i
didn't even i just and my manager was like yeah if ever this shit happens just fucking hell these
people need a reality check like some customers are actually insane and they just do not listen
to what people are actually saying and they just imagine slights so they can get free shit
or they can demand people get fired it's the most insane and this is one of like a thousand
stories retail is hell when you live in like the you're working some of the worst jobs and i had
like it was a nightmare and like i remember just being like what the fuck i knew and she was like
if you had told me that he had abused them he may have lost his job but i was just like how
arbitrary your life can be when you're in retail that a fucking annoying customer can cost you
everything just because they didn't listen to what you were actually saying
yeah generally when it comes to stuff like that jobs will put people on like a warning system
or they have like verbal warnings and written warnings and then temporary suspensions
um i worked before i did the internet stuff i worked in a hotel and while i was in that
hotel i did valet i did concierge i did um uh bellhop essentially um i worked in the restaurant
i worked in the banquets department we did all kinds of stuff we did so i know all about how
crazy people could be when you work all around the hotel and you see people coming in and out
and in and out and out every single day hundreds of people every day and everyone's got you know
most people you never remember because they're just in and out they just want to get along with
their lives every once in a while you see enough people that if you know 0.5 percent of people are
fucking psychos yeah you're gonna eventually run into a bunch of psychos it was eye-opening and
this is why i recommend everyone have that experience because like i said so many stories
like this one's quicker but uh we had a special when pokemon x and y released and they were like
you can um we give them out a card that has a code on it and it'll give you a free pokemon
when you put it into your whatever fucking console you have and like uh we ran out because the idea
was you give it with one card with every purchase of the game and eventually we ran out as then he
still does and a guy walked up to me he looked like he was in his 60s but he had the outfit of
like someone who was like fucking 10 years old he had like shorts and a nice like little shit
and he was holding his games and he was like uh the sign said that you get a free pokemon code
i'd like to have that i was like yeah sorry no we were out the the promotion doesn't been refilled
on our side so i can't give you that and he was like okay i can wait and he just stood there and
i was like uh no no i mean like like deliveries like this could be a week it could be more like
i don't know because i obviously i just work here i don't know what the actual deliveries are
but uh yeah we used to have you know we had a whole stack but we've given them out with
every game purchase and we've ran out now and he was like well that's unacceptable
and you just awkwardly stand there and he's like i'd like to speak to a manager
i'm like the manager will tell you the exact same and he's like i'd like to speak to a manager
and there's you hear about these stories as like almost jokes in movies and stuff but these
things happen people are insane like that and the manager comes down and tells you the exact
same fucking thing because they don't know anything about it so they ask me about it and
i tell them what i told them and they tell them the fucking customer and the customer's like
that's unacceptable and they're like okay do you want to see my manager it's like you want to see
the fucking co-owner of the store you want to talk to the ceo is that what you want and you just
want to wait you want us to fly you out to london to go to corporate headquarters to get into a
business meeting room with our ceo so we can explain to you that things are limited in this
finite world that's not acceptable you're free not to accept it just as long as you
don't accept it somewhere else that's not here and you'll find like the same guy comes back
the following day like have you got them now it's like i said like like oh jesus christ you just
don't want to live anymore and it was yeah nightmare i didn't leave that job because i
found a better one i left it out of pure stress it was a nightmare in the purest sense it was
the fucking worst job i've ever had and there's more stories to come but i don't want to delay
this too quickly it's just delay this more morally weirds fail me it's a bad thing and
if everyone goes to retail and experiences it'll make you a lot more humble about people in real
tale the best story i have and again i'll try and make this as quickly as possible is that we have
uh tents so think of them as uh several outdoor tent things and this is when i was this is before
software i was in control of outdoors first which is imagine everything you'd have outdoors you'd
have like the four foot tent then the six foot tent and then the 12 foot tent which many not many
people buy but this guy wanted a 12 foot tent i was like okay i'll go find one for you it took
me like 10 minutes in the back but i found a 12 foot tent and then by the time i was getting it
out for him i realized that the box was all damaged and i was like fuck i can't sell this
to a customer because this is just bad and then after another 10 minutes i found a 12 foot tent
and the box looked fine i checked it and it was like it was missing one of the most important
poles and i was like this can't work either then i i woke up to my tail to check the stock see if
it's more than two he was like is everything okay and i was like i i've just i there are two in
stock they they're just they're not uh i can't they're not sellable i was like and i think i
said something like they're reserved to try and cover it instead of saying they're just broken
because it makes the store look terrible i was like yeah uh yeah so i'm trying to find you
a more a different one he's like yeah okay fine and so i look for ages and then it says there's
one in like warehouse b like go over there and then i find out after searching for ages
from the guy who works the warehouses like oh no we sold that one we haven't recorded it yet and
i was like oh okay and you know after like a good half hour 40 minutes i remember coming back to
this guy with the unfortunate information that he's just wasted his time standing here we don't
have it and he's gonna have to wait x amount of time we'll go to a different store his reaction
okay thank you for looking and he left i was just like wow some people are thank you so much
yeah some people are you know nothing i can do about it and it's the idea that makes things appear
the fundamental thing you have to appreciate in retail and this is this isn't 100 true but most
of the time i don't want to waste your time i want you to get out and that's not supposed to be
rude it's me telling you that i'm trying to get the job done as quickly as possible so i can get
back to all the standard jobs that i have in the day regardless of customers which is typically a
lot customers are usually on top of whatever jobs you have to do in the day so when a customer's
like i want x you get it to them as soon as possible so you can get back on with your job
so the idea that it's like you've been fucking me over it's like no no no no trust me workers want
you to go satisfied as soon as possible uh so try not to demonize them that's all like and yeah i
really appreciate that guy that guy was like my favorite customer ever and all he did was say okay
that's the thing that you do ain't all about everything
typically and this is the thing it's not to say that everyone in retail is working their ass off
for you some people are assholes some some workers don't give a shit so but it's just try and stay
calm because my god i have some stories about the most asshole like fucking customers in history
and you know the meme about how it's like a 40 year old woman with that standard hairstyle
it's like yeah there was a lot of those yeah it's it's more than just a meme i swear but
yeah anyway moving on unless uh do you guys want to say anything else before i carry on hmm
no um i think i'm good there all right uh if you can prove oh yeah sorry sorry can you teach
for tier how to play this don't want to rehash that one uh can you teach for tier how to play a
snowball bitty game in uh pommel party my forehead hurts so much from all the face palming also rags
if i can ask how old are you you can ask do you wish to not answer or answer the question i am
i'm about three and a half by seven seven fourteen twenty one twenty
twenty four and a half is that your age i don't know okay either way uh yeah four tier is
fucking terrible at the snowball game in pommel party and it's like my favorite game which one
is that it's the one where you imagine being bad at pommel party you're all basically playing as
big balls and you slam into each other on a platform oh yeah that one's dumb fucking love
that one how do you know you're just bad at it if that's your case no i think it's i think
there's some kind of a glitch or a bug or something you're a bad man he's really bad at it and i wish
to for him to be better because i love that game anyway reading through the han solo trilogy i'm
sad none of this can be made canon not even the solo family can exist if solo is a made-up name
is a han solo trilogy in like writing written form i'm guessing or i guess they're books because i
haven't heard of i guess oh there's tons of star wars books i've never heard of like i said about
the captain marvel sequels if someone said like what the fuck would you want a han solo trilogy
it's like if it's well written i'd want it and i'm up for anything well written yeah if they're
good i'll watch them if they're crap then because you know the idea of like who the fuck asked for
a han solo prequel i i'm totally in that camp but that doesn't mean it can't be good
who the fuck needed a han solo prequel i understand that i fucking i'd understand a
snoke prequel more than that but off topic hey drinker do you efap drunk or do you find it easier
to get your criticisms up sober i'm afraid he can't answer that but i imagine he works sober
and then likes to deliver it while drunk i don't know we have to have a um keep an eye out for
like specific topical guest related super chats that's true actually we should try and do that
keep it's really hard because the whole premise of not reading out the super chats earlier than
this portion for them is to maintain the flow of conversation yeah so sometimes like if i'm into
it with someone else and then there's a question for them i'll miss it but um feels bad man but
homecoming equals bad comics adapt adaptation but fine film i'm okay with that i can't comment on
its adaptation but i think it's a fine film as well the only thing i've seen for the uh in terms
of it being an adaptation is the height ups video so i well i can't say i agree with that video he
talks more than just wait what was your point again say that again sorry the only video
the only thing i've seen about it being a bad spiderman adaptation is the high topic he makes
more than just an argument about it being a bad adaptation he says at one point that uh
something along the lines of like there are no repercussions for anything that happens in the film
that's his first point and then his point after that that's more than just a comic
adaptation point though then there's a line where he's like oh he also does face consequences but
those don't count well this is the problem i covered it with friggy and friggy was like oh
can i be on the efap we cover this i was like sure but i was like you probably want to be on
it as well and shad wants to be on it as well so we just have fucking everybody on it we'll have
another 10 million years fringy let message fringy tell him the efap now is he online yeah
well can you do it while i read out super jazz fine mauler i'll do it it's fine don't worry about
it i hope danvers pulls a denarius in the mcu i actually agree with that wait why would you
just ring him you gotta ask his permission first holy fuck i listen when he comes in we'll just
tell him right off the bat what you just did was a racism before you say anything fringy it's
important okay listen fringy all right we're live just let you know where efapping so anything
say cannon will be used against you in the court of public opinion why did you do this to this
so because i we jay and mauler and i we were we were talking um about retail um and we wanted to
ask you what was your opinion on the emancipation proclamation so against in the middle of what
this is out of we're super chatting all right okay rags why did you do this to this pull man
how could you do this he's okay so mauler mauler said what so the the emancipate that was lincoln
right why i don't know what you're talking about so we were doing an efap and i said hey we should
ask fringy if he wants to come on and mauler told me to do it and of course i fucked it up
because i don't know how to run this show so it's mauler's fault because he knew that i would mess
it up okay all right so i don't know what the situation with you is right now fringy in terms
of free time what happened was i mentioned he's got a lot of free time because of the emancipation
proclamation there's been a lot of talk about how spider-man homecoming is bad tonight and i mentioned
the hype now it's funny you say that because i literally got home from watching spider-man like
20 minutes ago oh shit you've seen the new one i have no spoilerinos what do you uh yeah i enjoyed
it uh the the post cred the last post credit scene is something um but yeah i i enjoyed it
yay is it better or worse than homecoming uh i'm probably gonna have to think about that um
it's kind of tough because homecoming is so solid oh careful fringy careful saying that
careful you can't say that you can't say that because mj's black what who cares i know who does
care apparently some people out there give a shit um i mean this one's a lot bigger in scope
like homecoming's quite a small story this one's a bit a lot bigger uh which is fine because i think
they handled it well and there was a lot of good stuff working for it in terms of character he's
absolutely not in the same place that he was at the start um as well as sort of uh you know
obviously setting things up for the future because this is the first post endgame movie well yeah it's
it's good i'm happy that you think that way because i mean me and you pretty much a one-to-one
on homecoming so i'm hoping i enjoy it yeah homecoming is awesome and anybody who says
it isn't is objectively wrong unfortunately oh my god this is spicy i'm sorry we've dealt with
a night of like chat and guests saying homecoming isn't very good we've got a straw poll up what
was it uh i've lost oh you know it's right on my screen now 40 percent of people in the straw poll
say that homecoming was not good 40 percent wow why why well well this is the thing so we were
talking about the high top video and i said that me and you watched it we thought it was terrible
and then rags was pretty good but we were currently talking about superchas we can't even
talk about that video unfortunately it's like i gotta go let's watch it right now i i don't
really want to i don't really want to see look look at what you've done you've disturbed this
poor frog slumber flash day kind of yeah look at this literally back to back these three comments
and chat from different people homecoming was average i loved homecoming homecoming is
overrated i don't even know that there's any kind of consensus on homecoming underrated as fuck yeah
but the thing is it is underrated because a lot of people don't say that it's one of the best
ones which it is i said that i said that very controversial it's the thing i thought it was one
of the most securely solid ones yeah for me it's in the top three i'm surprised it's not so highly
received that's why we say it's under the problem wait the problem is right now we are four people
who think homecoming is pretty great so this is right so we gotta because people in chat are gonna
be very frustrated there's no one here to represent the idea that it's not great that's why i want to
make an efap for it i want to have videos we can cover about it i want to have guests that hate it
so we can get a good old conversation about it instead of just dragging innocent mr fringy on
to just say that it's good you know we can't you can't be doing that rude yeah yeah rags is the true
villain of efap am i am i really or am i just a different kind of hero the anti-hero
yeah no i mean that's a good that's a good hopefully i can enjoy watching it i'm seeing
homecoming on tuesday i believe that a couple people see rags did you say you're seeing on
wednesday or did wolf say that i can i i don't know i i don't have any like specific plans to
see it we're just gonna see it when it comes down no as long as you see it before next sunday
because that's probably when we'll talk about it okay i think that people i think people are
actually uh like the original sam rammy ones there's a there's a little thing in there that
i think they'll like without saying anything there's a little there's a little thing in there
that they'll like but um do you think it'll be better received than homecoming well um
he's not in new york you know uh in like he's he's not i don't know i this is what i mean it's
a lot of people yes um people say things like oh man it'd be good to see him actually like
web slinging around new york um he's not in new york um though i mean obviously like
there's stuff that is in the trailers though but um but i don't know it feels like a lot of people
don't like it because it's not very traditional you know in terms of where it is and what he's
doing and things like that but that's why i like it because we've already had five spider-man movies
no we need another origin story for spider-man he has to get bit by a radio actor spider in science
lab the majority of us haven't seen it and we haven't got anybody who disagrees with it so
it'll it'll have its time chat don't worry those five spider-man there are there are things like
there are things that we will that are a little bit like iffy in terms of um plot yeah like there
there are just things where i was down like that seems a little bit far fetched i've got to imagine
somebody would have noticed that or things like that but um but and yeah i think i think the post
credit scene is going to be uh real interesting to hear what people will think of that one hmm it's
uh it it changes a lot um despite the fact that i don't think it intended to i'm really curious now
i can't wait to see it and when i see it i'll finish it and i'll message fringy like hey
want to talk about how terrible it is and frickin be like either way i mean it's uh i mean it's
really like in terms of marvel movies this year it's in a good spot because while i think we all
enjoyed endgame a lot it's riddled with problems yeah sprits and plot perspective and captain marvel
is the worst one and there's really like nothing else that's coming out no strong competition i
understand no all right well i mean it's up to you if you want to stay or not but we're currently
reading through super chess yeah i'll stay but i'll be back in a couple of minutes all right
how the heck does doom eternal look bad by what metric can it be considered lacking i'm so
truggered well that would have been answered truggered uh oh thank christ they finally got the
drink up praise be saint don the benevolent adopter of orphans rider of motorcycle motorcycles
breaker of awkward silence and protector of the innocent i completely agree salad
would you rather have an all-inclusive 24-hour date with the don at the end of which you will
die peacefully and painlessly or spend 12 hours with the don before he dies peacefully in the hospital
i would rather die i don't think we can deprive the world of the don
oh yeah that's gonna that's a toughie that'll be the prime that's that's really a toughie
that was from mr massive by the way so that guy knows his shit a tough question i would go with
the prior because the don spreads positivity like no one else but what would but what would the don
want yeah that's the ultimate i think don will be upset at the idea that someone dies for him
he's already had so many people he had his wife died who knows i don't know
uh captain marvel has a higher kill count than thanos that's not true i don't think that's true
uh technically she has a higher kill count possibly than the thanos from end game but not
from the thanos of i don't think anyone can beat thanos' kill count doesn't fucking have a kill
count yeah he does he's been obliterating planets up to that point oh yeah okay i don't screen kill
count like a confirmed oh in that case yeah he doesn't he killed literally nobody actually i
don't think he killed anyone did he only hit people i don't think he actually killed anybody
he's the good guy confirmed that was already thanos did nothing wrong 30 years between captain
marvel and end game why didn't captain marvel try to stop thanos at any point during that period
it's established in guardians that thanos is known galaxy wide as space hitler well let me tell you
about something called a retcon that means that when the story is already running someone adds
a thing in there and sometimes it can be really clunky and it ruins everything we call this captain
marvel that's because she's flawed why didn't you stop thanos she's like uh there are other
planets in the galaxy that need my help that don't include thanos she was like he was literally
decked out by list when he did the thing okay she's justified she didn't stop uh she didn't stop
thanos for the same you you cut out what did you say she didn't stop thanos for the same reason i
haven't watched lord of the rings and what reason is that i don't know but
i want them to adapt civil war too so we can watch the the feminists and the minorities fight
over whose side is right hey so uh civil war two huh do you guys know anything about civil war
two the comic yes they're not gonna do it they're not gonna do it there's there's no way i mean
it's it's basically minority report except they try to unironically present it as though the pro
minority reports do you really think they'll make captain marvel the obvious bad guy i feel like
gree larson would be like no yeah but the thing is like the comic kind of doesn't treat her like
she's clearly wrong it kind of like presents it as though tony's a little bit i don't know
overly paranoid i was like no like he's right unequivocally right that's why it's such a bad
story and everybody fucking hates that one that's your opinion don is anakin done right
what don and anakin connected uh if you haven't seen tonal's new format it's incredible we will
be covering it that was actually a backup there's it's not it's not it's not you might assume from
the term new format that it's very different it's not very different it's different though
and we will definitely cover on efap it was going to be a backup today if we got through the third
video but as you can tell that the second video took us to a second efap so there was no fucking
chance we're going to be okay but yes we will definitely cover him he's a glorious boyo uh the
best doggo has returned to us high rags missed you hello it's i i missed me too here you go
only three things are certain in life death taxes and spider-man coming out benjamin bow frank
laggins benjamin i just intro'd my little brothers to lord of the rings hashtag one less j
uh have any of you guys played bloodstained i'd nope no no point asking j for your anniversary
special you should have james moron we could do that i don't know if james moron you have moron
whoa oh damn i didn't mean to insult but that's how wids work they sound like different things
when they put up with different words that's my bad uh wolf have you switched breath of the wild
to pro mode i'm gonna say no on that wolf is very bad at breath of the wild is not a pro he is super
cash he's bad conclusion i guess you guys should get tonaled on efap 50 to mark a special occasion
he'll never come on he refers to us as hate videos okay so getting him on will be impossible but
honestly if we get him on he'll probably be episode 100 that would be the time where we get
him on and i will try for episode 100 you can hold me to that but i i'm not promising anything um
trick him into it and then from james more we did read this out but your next rags i'll dm you on
thursday using discord then i'll move to tgpp so we can get efap versus them eventually love y'all
yep rags is next up for a switch that is that is insanely an already extremely generous person
doing even more generous that is is he the don he might be the don he wears a helmet to try and
protect the fact that he's not the don because we would know and it is it is within don's character
to well wear helmets so i i can't help but wonder if he's the one if he's the don in disguise
so not sure if you guys have seen it but you should look at legal eagle's pinned response
on that video it's one hell of a noof we actually discussed it was it yesterday yesterday yeah we
talked about it yesterday funnily enough um we could i'll make a note we could put that on efap
actually we'll we'll we'll read it out and just talk about it just for that super chat no not now
we'll do it for the next one all right read eagle eat legal all right gotta spell this correctly
otherwise what's the point in life legal eagles pinned are meant on record that because i could
just i could just post the recording of it i thought my whole point was that you failed to record it
no i did record it i was no i i thought i failed to record it and then i realized i did record it
and that was the whole well either way no because efap is not the same as just uploading some random
recording jay what universe are you from um i'm a lot so this is from l don i'm a long time rags
viewer and i found the streams through him i haven't stopped efapping since he's the best
boy mauler and wolf are icing on the cake gracias for the days of quality streams
cool big rags fan from mr l don and is it a coincidence that his name is the same as the
savior of efap i think not oh so after i watch the end game efap i hear that it's back in theaters
why was why was it me uh so so the the idea is that they've added deleted scenes apparently
that's going right now in my theaters have you seen anything to do with that fringy are you
watching that right now uh i've heard what you're talking about the re-release of um yeah of end game
yeah i've heard about it um i mean i wouldn't go no i mean i'll just wait for the i'll just wait
for it on uh hey like google play okay that's fair enough i just mean i i don't know how much
they've changed i'm tempted to go see it myself i i think i wouldn't mind doing it why not uh but
yeah maybe they had a funeral for that oh that probably should have been in the movie
they dead a scene for it they were talking about how they were sad that people died it was there
hulk throws a bench into a puddle that's not the scene i'm referencing it's the one where hulk is
sad face and then also scarlet witch is sad face because their girlfriend slash boyfriend
slash robots have died oh that scene is nice yeah uh all this artwork is more valuable someone else's
funeral that that scene takes place people have died you know you don't need dude how clunky would
it be if they had a fucking full-on funeral for every character that died well okay in obviously
not after infinity war but in end game only two characters die right so no wait who am i missing
all of thaddeus's minions you're gonna have a funeral for each
shut the fuck up the black water yeah but that'd be great if they had a funeral for thaddeus
you just yeah you have like a thing pushed out into the water and you have all the space dogs
there mournful in tuxedos yeah thousands and thousands talking to each other uh all this
artwork is more valuable than whatever i could get or give i james moor said that the artwork
was amazing but i mean don't don't it's tough to value things in that way don't ever it's
complicated there's no definitive answers money is as worth as what people see it as worth it as it
is objective that what jay just said that thing upside down skittles of fives rags duh
uh upside upside down skittles of five and no it's an s i think it's yeah still an s isn't
i'd have to clarify that with science uh well no let's just use our noggins here
s you flip it upside down it's still an s what about if it's at 90 degrees that's your opinion
no i don't think so all right i hear it's paint just draw an s and flip it
no that's what i'm fucking doing oh my god it's
it's a it's um well yeah i was right wasn't i again well it's like a backwards yes
it's not a five though it's it's backwards s like like the point on the top of the s is
facing the right but if you flip it upside down then now it's pointing to the left did you flip
vertically or did you rotate it i flipped vertically because that's not actually what
what kind of fucking bullshit is that what do you mean what kind of bullshit is that that's true
flip vertical yeah if you flip vertically it goes like yeah okay right well betty yet
if you rotate it 180 but if you turn a schedule it's just a weird symbol
when you make when you perform the action of flipping a skittle what do you do do you rotate
it or do you invert the physical existence when you rotate at 180 it's an s when you flip it
vertically it's a weird squiggle if you flip a skittle around it's just gonna have no letter at
all well yeah there's gonna be an s on the other side yeah but you can't see but if you turned it
you know if you have a skittle and you flip it around then you're looking at the s on the back
now there is no uh aren't aren't they're at two s's on i'm pretty sure there's one s is there
an s on the front in the word skittles it begins and it ends with an s so it makes sense that each
one has an s on each side doesn't know i don't know i don't need to get pretty sure they have
skill i'm pretty sure skills have s on one side like m&m's i don't know maybe that seems wiggle it
skittles what are you googling i'm not really doing how many sides the skills have enough
of you they have an infinite amount of sides because they're fucked up round it looks well
i went to amazon to skittles and i have a picture of skittles and many of the skittles pictured
do not have s's on them uh let me show you a definitive look i'm just looking at a bunch
of skittles right now i'm posted in the chat some of them don't because that's where i said
just a second ago that's the picture i was using some have s's some don't yeah the ones that don't
have the s are the ones that i can't see yes that's what i'm saying yeah they're on one side
yeah they're on the side we can't see we you said they were on both sides i said they might be
well okay well you're wrong i didn't know i don't i'm not a skittle connoisseur i don't
all right don't partake of the skrittles often
skrittles the skrittles
i barely eat m&m's and i and i'm fairly certain that if you flip it uh it becomes a
skittles are not better than m&m's yes they are no absolutely not that earlier in the stream i swear no
no no no no no no m&m's are better than skittles and take correct that's incorrect yeah absolutely
yeah m&m fuck it chat m&m's taste better than skittles absolutely they do are we done m&m's
ask for skittles fuck it no m for skittles ask for m&m's absolutely mmm
so the next question is skittles are better have you watched in an opposite way it's on
netflix i've not seen even jelly and has anyone else here i'm pretty sure it's pronounced
evangelicalian and why would i i just admit i know it's evangel i don't fucking know how
you weird people pronounce things i'm from britain the lions i've managed the lion
has anyone seen it here no i haven't damn um if the stream is under eight hours i want to refund
well there you go we made it over eight hours so look at all those two streams doesn't count
obviously imitants are better than skittles it's not even close not even close holy crap i'd
say it is pretty close actually it isn't they're clear what's happening is really
skittles are better than imms no why is happening a straw poll
you can make that straw poll go ahead holy crap molar wall frags in the critical drinker don't
pinch me i don't want to wake up from this dream we're in desperate need of a serious drunken
collaboration on something horrible you got it that was the thing that happened i'm i love how
the stream is so long that i'm probably going to be sober by the time i go to sleep uh pretty neat
the last time a wahmen move on efap was number 20 this is number 40 so does that make critical
drinker a wahmen yes yes also hey there rags how are you hey i'm great i'm doing really good things
are good in my life yeah i'll show off my report molar even though you enslave your guests without
pay this one can go to rags this is ten dollars all right so i have to remind myself to you have
to give me your paypal email rags so i can get to some you all right you all right so i have the
results of the straw poll on the screen right now it's very it's not even close it's very very clear
that it's literally it's 50 50 no no i posted it's 50 50 m&m's is running away with it look at
all that it's currently 50 50 it's got it is crushing the polls remember chat answer honestly
oh no that's not looking good no m&m's is definitely better i mean okay wait so
you're 100 let's assume there's a gun to your head your family are on the line which do you
actually prefer fringy what's your answer uh i probably would prefer m&m's yeah i prefer m&m's
but that's my i'm precisely biased that i prefer chocolate to sweets that's my take on that even
though sweets you're old you're old at some day hey hey which was your favorite lord of the rings
movie jay and jade ever spoke
this is intense this is a quite close one until it wasn't right it's still relatively oh oh no
yeah it looks like there's a comfortable lead for m&m's now 60 40 as many people are right
as many people are right about this as as people about spider-man
did god confirm that jay is that what god did yes i disagree with god he's in it
well maybe so but i demand
god explain himself scenario yeah i think you mean god explain herself
and god explain itself is the kind of yeah it looks like 60 40 is the split on an average
which means jay has been defeated ultimately
also it's salad penance is to watch all the lord of the rings movies salad king wants 10 to go
to wolf and to critical drinker as well i will sort that out no problem and regs and fringy gets all
zero dollars just just just demand some money and someone will give it to you i swear
i don't really want to do that why does that somehow it ruin your integrity i don't understand
what's wrong with demanding money from people who are trying to enjoy your content for free
what is wrong with that imagine they touched your map yeah that would be abuse
uh also ragas you need to stream this is for ragas two i will add thanks i do stream fund
you're up to you're up to 62 right now rags
62 dollars i'm gonna be paying you that as soon as this is done oh really you're like really well
in finish i've never been paid for efap before in fairness the this is my reparations it's 10 and
2 from these ones but there was a 50 on the other stream but you have i haven't spoken to
in a long time so i just yeah that'll together it shall be done uh day off thunderstorms playing
doom 2016 streaming efap living the dream thank you no pro i didn't reinstall doom 2016 good shit
because i man i that multiplayer is amazing interestingly for the uh the guy we had on
he said that he loved 2016 he just thinks that the new one looks like it's going to be bad
i i think that's where he's coming to because with a lot of games they just try to do too much
but i think that the i mean doom has always been fairly mechanically simple
so it would probably do well for a bit of uh like in single player i'm totally down for it
but i do actually have investment in doom multiplayer as i've said before just recently
i really love doom 2016's multiplayer um and i think they're outsourcing the multiplayer too
so i'm curious how the attachments will work in multiplayer hopefully into op or stupid but i
think for single player it'll work fantastically oh uh no homo but i would play monopoly with you
oh yeah it's kind doing that doom voice killed my throat rip oh so dr bozon was the guy who did
the doom voice um wonderful we enjoyed it how are you all how are how are all of you beautiful
hate mongers today i'm well i'm doing very well i'm all right i woke up started efap had to leave
came back still fapping if we go through with the 24 hour one for the 50th episode that shit's
going to be trying we're going to be like trying for the audience if they can keep up with us yes
that is the take is the take question for wolf do you drink your do you drink your
burners or is that winners v-e-r-n-o-r that i drink vernor vernor v-e-e-r-n-o-r um let me check
um it is a it's ginger ale soda i didn't even know that's what he drank i don't remember him
specifying i've never even heard of verners before i will put that in the wolf thingies
that i've got going in my notepad so i'll make sure he gets to answer that i like ginger ale though
it's yummy wolf rags are you actually each other's types if you knew each other irl would you go out
out where to the zoo i think he means sexually oh i don't know maybe you know what wolf looks
like have you seen an image of him um i think i have but i've sort of forgotten and in a weird
way i want to forget like i don't i don't want to know what any of you guys look like yeah i know
you mean you like to just maintain whatever the image yeah i like i like the image i like the
voice in the picture and hearing you in my head uh and he said yes or he says why or why i don't
know if it meant to be why i mean maybe i think i could get along i think i could probably get
along with wolf but the thing is i'm kind of i really really enjoy my personal space and being
able to get away from people like i'm not really a guy that i don't really i'm not into like serious
relationships and there's an element of like let's say you were friends with wolf irl you might be
like i don't want to potentially ruin the friendship with uh yeah plus wolf's a fag so i don't know how
that would work in the long run but fair enough interesting question maula use music from cotor
in your star wars critiques i stick to the movie music because i only stick to the movie criticism
but if i was to involve cotor i would consider it uh why are you watching doom eternal spiderman is
out it's not out in britain yet oh yeah or america stupid australia live in the future that's their
benefit i'm pretty sure i came out in china on friday well fuck the china man the china does china
really exist have you been there yeah let me guess you've seen pictures you've heard stories yeah
because no real proof huh no real proof this is i hate green people making these kind of statements
without any kind of fucking up i bet you think australia is real too yeah see nothing island
far far away from civilization where the spiders eat birds yeah i'm not buying that oh the spiders
are as big as dinner plates yeah okay there used to be an old prison colon yeah yeah yeah
oh croc has a six foot okay conspiracy theory about how britain killed their prisoners instead
of sending them to australia and australia was a cover-up that's the thing this is australia
it's not real oh yeah it's not real theory now is that actually real or i swear i've seen
people australia is flat it's not spherical that is the truth that's your opinion doesn't even deny
doesn't even deny it i deny it he is a verbal terrorist of the toxic brood
now now that's that's an interesting term verbal terrorism
hey that's that's what the toxic brood does yeah uh here's money for the memes thank you corry
i personally think flinn tagard is relatable in doom who's flinn tagard
is he the main dude is that the name of doom guy no no his not name is flinn that's gay flinn
tagard or fly for short was born on august 15th 1969 in denver colorado he is the protagonist
of the original doom novels oh i didn't know that i shared a link to uh it says aka bj
blaskowitz the third oh is this real i'll read this flat have you ever been to australia australia
is not real it's a hoax made for us to believe that britain moved over their criminals to some
place in reality these criminals were loaded off the ships into the waters drowning before that
didn't see land again it's a cover-up for one of the greatest mass murders in history manned up
by one of the most prominent empires australia does not exist all things are absolutely well
fabricated lies are the documents made by the leading governments of the world you're australian
friends they're all actors and computer generators thought to trick the world if you think you've
ever been to australia you're terribly wrong the plane pilots are all in on this they've all
actually flowed you to the islands uh close nearby or in some cases parts of south america
where they employ space and hired actors to act out as real australians come this can't be real
this cannot be real it's in a flat earth group yeah we wouldn't believe the fly earth believers
are real so well the whole thing about this show have you ever been to australia
well at what point do you think this is all an this is a this is a cover-up that's gonna cost an
incredibly insane amount of money and what is the point continue with into perpetuity
to do what to cover up potential murder of criminals yeah like does he not realize that
just killing people killing criminals in the 18th century was super common and nobody really gave
a shit yeah yeah it's like is a really massive inquis uh you know inquisitorial research being
done into what happened to really rags using the swear word he said massive let's just
degenerate would surely not surely if like what's the fucking even population of australia today
seven like 25 million people would that would that be one of the biggest mass murders of history
surely like more people have been killed in that and fucking genocides biggest genocides
well it's just like okay so they got 25 million actors they got 25 million kangaroos because
that's about how many there are like what are the kangaroos are they just like people in costumes
jumping around of course of course okay so moving on doom guy is more relatable than most of the guys
you cover so he even uh he even makes terminator two reference when he dies doom guy's cultured
i agree very developed character the kids who have the same first name in my high school so we
called them by their last names i don't know if that was relevant something we were talking about
probably was but it's so hard to remember talking about how uh calling the doom games the same name
would uh and then like someone was like imagine if you had two karls in the same room it would get
confusing rags if you were in a room with two karls you would of course refer to them as karl and
karl eternal man how how shitty would it be if you were the one just you were the one who became
all eternal you'd be like why am i i'm okay with this actually all right you are the karl
eternal and you're you're just karl thank you wolf for recommending the expanse audiobooks i've
listened to the first one and you were right about the narrator it was amazing i'm sure you'd
appreciate that i will copy it and prepare it for him in the future they pronounce that word right
yes no disagreements i yeah i'm gonna win it yeah this is from blue jay jay is very geode
oh yeah thank you damn it now i gotta pay jay too okay so that's 10 for rags for wolf for critical
drinker and for jay and i already know that there's some on the way for fringy it depends how
he'll find out how much if he stays for x amount of time oh this is like if you say like man as a
joke you'll be great if i had some money people will do it jay joke about it right now he'll get
money yeah it sure would be great if i had some money like shut up jay wow let's see what happens
uh i put down agreements doom eternal the officially licensed browser is a good game
for heavy handed gentlemen geode the poll isn't glowing but cia knickers sure are
that's from rah rah has very interesting super chats we have to decide knickers uh sausage milk
to the massive in chat who came after me after what i said about the poll and tried to tell me
what this podcast is about i've been here since day one with the spiciest super chats you boomer
reddit whore all right oh god there's so many from rah there's on this page that i've got
where you've got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen i
can see 14 and of the 14 nine of them are rah do you control f for rah there's a lot of there's
a lot of rah he just super chatted saying here's some money don't give any to jay
jay how do you feel about that i'm sure i'm sure that can be arranged uh this guy probably
loves my subdivision love y'all i mean yeah most people would argue that anything that's poorly
written is a subdivision so yeah it works you know a lot of good things anyway i want a mod
for this game that puts pride flags and pro-abortion signs in the hands of all the demons
i you probably make that mod yourself i imagine i don't know if anyone has
this video is spastic these things are bad because they're not old doom these
things are bad because they are old doom isn't anything not bad i mean we did try to explore
each of his issues when he came on um i i don't know i don't know what you could conclude from
what he said but um i think he did he say that he would he would he wouldn't have said it was
terrible if he was to remake the title i can't remember jay you remember he said that and then
he went on to say oh yeah but i still terrible hmm i swear i swear that's what happened it was
a strange it was it's been the entire night time and now it's daytime again yeah it's 5 21
me and jay are gonna be able if we make it for another hour and 40 minutes we will actually
outdo the previous long record uh even though actually jay only turned up two hours into the
shut up yeah so no you won't actually be able to i will have the record finally no end it end it
now doom 2016 law is amazing it connects and references to every doom game from what i'm aware
of the og doom had a story it was just a simple one that's the thing i'm not opposed to a story
in doom go for it especially if it's well written holy shit it's great uh daily reminder amir did
nothing wrong 17 centuries of mamali's mamali cost is a lie stop hating your ancestors and
fighting mali's wars that's a reference to north mythology and i think wolf said he's
the only person who would understand it because he's the only person who knows north mythology
enough to be there we go i guess uh me waiting for eldon ring and secaro dlc is like dumbled or
crying in that scene in the cave from the end of half blood prince the world or cry in half blood
prince i don't remember oh nobody here likes double door cry i i haven't i haven't partaken
of like any harry potter related stuff in ages i don't remember uh this idiot just wants another
have you seen harry potter yeah i've seen all of them that's actually something i'd assume he did see
and he has uh this idiot just wants another call of duty clone i don't think it was that simple
but i don't know how complicated it was either i don't give a crap about doing eternal until
the pride flag mod comes out just give me kojima's bullshit and eldon ring right now
you'll get them eventually seven out of ten too many plot holes not sure what that's a reference
to yellow pole bad yeah the yellow pole was the worst thing about doom eternal let's be
anyone who's red pilled knows why this guy is probably attacking the poles
probably a reference to to polish people i don't know it's a joke in there i didn't know i thought
the poll anyway i'm mauler having seen the great british podcast where nitpicks guested i wondering
if you would debate them on objectivity versus subjectivity question i like them but their points
need taking down by the long man yeah so unfortunately uh they get they had nitpicks
on to guest which is a popular video essay podcast and he was like there is no way to
objectively assess a movie and i'm not saying this is my take but a lot of people's take was
that they inefficiently argued against him and he actually p.m me to come on and argue about it but
i was asleep and i woke up an hour after he'd asked me and i was like oh come on then he was
like it's too late we've moved on i was like oh no oh so maybe i don't know if nitpicks would want
to come on to this podcast though if they knew me wolf and rags would be like objectivity is a
thing roar you know that could be terrifying fringy doesn't come on this podcast specifically
for that reason what i'm not a bigot i believe in equality for all i'm just saying poles have
a right to self-determination and deciding the direction for their nation all right then
yeah sure i agree what do you want from doom let's just say i would love it if they were
hyper realistic and set in a super liberal city center
all right yay for drinker on efap was wondering if uh drinker if you would consider tom clancy's
actual novels as an influence credit to the dude from doom vid from coming on to chat hope you
enjoy eternal i hope he enjoys it too and as for the question for drinker uh i mean
kind of difficult because i can't exactly send him a message and have him respond to it
it's unfortunate that yeah we'll try and look out for them in future guest questions
the unfortunate thing is that if we started doing that there could be a buildup of guest questions
because the super chest want to sort of be responded to and then it could fuck things up
i don't know how the best do that but uh yeah a lot of guests are not able to stay for the
the amount of hours that the hosts are because the hosts have girth that's unmatched isn't that
right guys and length um length and girth they can't handle it not sure if you've heard but
everything great about made a video on captain marvel if you need more content i have not seen it
but it's just a part one yes the thing he's made he's making two parts on how great captain marvel
is it's like uh the only other things he's done that for infinity will uh what did you say the
only other things he's done that for as far as i'm aware are infinite
so it's infinity war lord of the rings captain marvel yeah i mean most people do say that those
are the greatest movies to exist so i love them they're great i just i well we we might cover it
one day there's a lot of things in line to cover so maybe one day drinker i normally don't like
channels with a shtick but i like yours a lot like i do toss pots keep it up but when that
shtick is alcohol i'm game yeah i think he and toss pot will both keep it up stacey mauler um
do you even like know who we are rah i don't know i don't make sense of that i don't understand
mr mr man when he arrived mr doom man oh his name was oh well i mean i did say to him is that
i was genuinely just curious it didn't matter if he did or not i was just curious if he'd
because because he was weird he actually said as a point of pride that his video managed to
get him onto this podcast which is like i was just like oh i didn't know that that's how people
would feel about this podcast you know but they make a video so bad that it gets them on there
is a good thing you know i mean yeah it's a little i mean anyone who's made a video
bad enough to be fat deserves bad things to happen to them except that j guy he's all right
no he's the worst i agree id software presents jimmy dean sausage eternal
come on guys he just doesn't like thick it's okay to be wrong sometimes yeah okay it is okay to be
wrong i'll be fine with the polls if they add a mod that lets you use the polls to beat women
and men who say the 19th amendment was a good idea what's the 19th amendment yeah don't worry
about it the 19th amendment i believe that was the one i gave the women the right to okay
the new doom guy does kind of look like he was drawn by rob leafield i'm assuming that's a
sausage enthusiast what else could it be of course there are many sausage enthusiasts in the world
props to you dude for being a good sport yeah if any if anything i if i missed to say it like
thanks for coming on person who made the doom video cry more that guy he uh thanks for coming
it was always nice to hear that the content creator bond because when he said he had several
things to say to us as a response i was like oh god i hope that we haven't like fucked everything
up but it did seem just to be that took the criticism in stride from what i understood so
i'm mostly a video when your video has a dislike ratio that bad it's kind of difficult to not take
more criticism in your strike i mean did he say that was one of the the most like the ratios is
one of the most disliked videos in the history of youtube he i think he said yes which doesn't
surprise me it was worse than youtube rewind ratio as well not numbers
i mean like of course the worst ratios of the ones that got like one dislike and no likes but
right they're not really if yeah that'll count uh i'll take a doom guy that has thick wrists over
a doom guy with spliced dick any day at least doom didn't get the geezer war estrogen treatment
spliced dick i guess because the protagonists of the new geezer war gills i'm assuming that's the
contention spliced dick i don't know what am i supposed to do with that rags i don't need you
to translate what spliced dick is referring to google it i don't know hey wolf just got ory on
sale i hope it's good i could wolf adores ory i think ory's awesome hopefully you'll enjoy it
movement speed in eternal is actually slower gay j what it's slower gay j
that's not relevant to me apparently it is i don't know hopefully it's not too slow
congrats on 200k subscribers that was a big barrier of blockage to overcome
why thank you david any update on tfa part three uh currently working on the game of thrones one
it's going to be about two hours and 40 minutes i am still uh getting the audio done which means
recording the script and then editing the audio as well as any parts where i'm like referencing
clips and stuff it's about half half-ish way done i've had a cold recently i've been muting every
time i cough so that it doesn't interrupt the stream it's been really frustrating because
whenever i record i have to take like a million takes because you can tell when someone so like
the difference would be me saying something like this that'd be saying something like this you'd
be like oh he's clearly there's something wrong with his delivery so i feel like so yeah i'm
trying to are you gonna be okay see see right there that's the problem so it's delayed me a bit
but there's a very longman video on the way and i'm already very happy with the script it's all
about the question are you are you afraid to tell us that it's cancer it's all about episode
five of season eight of game of thrones that it will come out as for tfa part three it's only in
script form i will tell you guys as soon as i start making that but it's still not being
currently made uh it will be eventually that's okay i can do as an update i'm afraid working on
something else are you are you aware of the news what news the Anna sister
yes uh we did talk about it i'll talk about it again uh once we reach the end of this as well
oh man all right um congrats on okay sorry i read that uh also nice to have a fellow Scotsman on
efap in fitness jay is quite the Scotsman you may not have been born there but he's got the
scot blood in him right jay jesus scotman i live in scotland are you a scotman though i am not a
scotman originally but i i like to feel that i have become more scotman than i used to be
you sound kind of like a sissy yes you need to you're you're going to drink a bit more and get
some air on your chest and you gotta fucking interrupt people whenever they're talking about
something and then you gotta drink a lot i know it yeah you haven't got the fucking accent right
do you i can't do the accent on demand i can sometimes do it why you mean you can't bloody
do the accent on command oh neither can you apparently oh yes i can do it i do it all the
time to all my scottish friends oh jeez um i'm uncomfortable now oh you wouldn't be uncomfortable
if you were a true scotsman oh cool there's a wasp in my room why didn't you kill it for
invading your country i've got shutters it's on the window i can just shut it
in that small space and it won't bother me can you talk about raps i'm not a wasp i'm a massive
a massive wasp it's massive um womb raider starring beefy sausages and big poles
i know i think this womb shall be your doom enough with the luke defenses all white heroes
are being destroyed stop defending this i'm not even white i'm bloody persian
persians can be white persians a nationality not a race there you go love your content wolf
mauler and rags you guys should go on hannibal and monty's shit show like you they appreciate
good writing and film who's hannibal and monty shit show never heard of it if they invite us
we can totally jump on yeah absolutely on godzilla i'm a huge fan of godzilla and i
argue that godzilla king of the monsters is not only objectively bad but also a fucking
insult to godzilla fans i've got a script and i'm collecting clips but i'm going to scream at this
for an hour 20 shout out so he's called steve's thoughts gonna make a video on why king of the
monsters is not only bad but bad for godzilla fans too check it out if you want to know i mean
that's pretty much the position that me and rags are on is fucking terrible film but well well
hold up i don't think we said it was bad for godzilla fans right because i don't exactly know
what that means so yeah if anything what i have come to learn is that godzilla fans seem to have
very very low standards yes the standard is we like to see monsters hit each other okay
oh what their their standard is ooh king of the monsters which i can understand 100 by the way
uh that movie was great except people realize that there are no white people in hollywood stop
attacking characters i love because of your because you are a glee and need affirmative action
i mean you can you can have non-white people it's all good if anyone in chat is invested in the
music industry what do you think of the gibson controversy lately my thoughts screw gibson
i have no idea in controversy gibson we'll probably have to the guitars right i think
well as far as i'm aware they make a lot of stuff like they make amps as well i'm pretty
sure they're just like a production company for music related instruments heck i don't know
yeah i guess um if anyone can fill us in on what the gibson controversy is i would appreciate it
because i um i don't actually know what the gibson controversy is hmm there's a controversy
surrounding gibson i i gathered that i don't know i don't know because contrary to popular belief
the spanish-american war was not fought either between the spanish nor the americans hmm they
were fought by the australians against the british to prove that australia absolutely
absolutely it's it's one of the most missed well the alleged australian yeah i was about to say
we all know we're actually an offshoot of the belgians oh i need to stop being king because i'm
a runaway drunk who failed now take over the throne and take my kingdom oh runaway drunk
black lesbian yeah i didn't think it was particularly great myself is she a lesbian
uh i i don't allegedly allegedly i guess if you i guess if you're a valkyrie
and just surrounded by vag all day you're probably going to develop a liking
kind of like how going to an all boys catholic school turned me gay i think she's a lesbian in
the same way dumbledore is gay like it's never in the actual or anything that like someone said it
once so it must be true she's a token lesbian okay dumbledore is a token gay he's like a he's
like a gay but without being confirmed gay in the thing so it's like oh he's gay by the way
he's like okay cool thanks apparently gibson is suing dean because of the shape of their guitars
however many guitar bodies are designed in an ergonomic way so there's not so much they can do
with the body of a guitar all right sounds like gibson of being twats maybe i don't know more
context might reveal the difference maybe um i'm sick of these jews attacking masculine men
i don't know i don't know i don't i don't i don't i don't know about that
seems like a little stretch to me oh wait i did read this one out before but molly you're
objectively wrong about the thaw mum scene and this will always be your worst take they had mommy
make him a soy cuck instead of odin coming but if you had odin come back and give him a boosting
scene again wouldn't that kind of be like redundant it's like jesus christ every single time thaw gets
in any way like discouraged thaw odin turns up in a dream sequence to go hey you're good yeah and
then when it happens in ragnarok it kind of it kind of loses its impact you know and i like the idea
that the mom has something to say to him that boosts him but yeah it's a controversial subject
so a lot of people hate what they did with thaw so yeah i think thaw definitely could have been
handled better without a doubt they said i don't think it was like terrible you can prove the wrong
right now by coming up with a mistake go free palestine
okay what do you have to say um nothing exactly exactly silence is uh something i heard that that's
true mark wade and alex ross kingdom come comic is very good way a hero who fails is redeemed
they could have used that for thaw fair enough all right oh sweetie you don't have to be a strong
responsible leader for your people just sit back and eat cheez-its while bulls and foreigners take
over i mean valkyrie was a naz guardian person foreign are taking over but i still don't know
my problem is more to do with their credentials but then when you're dealing with something that's
down to like a village that's the size of your entire civilization maybe a leader at that point
becomes a little arbitrary as to point yeah maybe it's like i'm coming here yeah you know uh that
party scene where they compare their gfs was great but cuckweed and ruined that moment with
maria hill coughing and going testosterone i mean when guys are showing off how good their
girlfriends are i think there's a thing to be said there that that's a masculine move i don't know
that's reasonable and and if you're a woman you don't want to lose that
you don't want to you want to you don't want to be the ugliest girlfriend in the
what as god controlled like seven worlds tops all right because i think critical drinker said oh i
don't remember who said it but they said something like it's a galaxy spanning thing i don't know
that's the problem with the mcus we don't actually know the influence of as god exactly
they control the is it seven realms i can't actually remember the number but yeah something
like that because the kree empire is also supposed to start off with their unifying them well he's
correct they apparently got out of control and he's trying to re-control them but the kree empire
is supposed to spread through the milky way galaxy right or am i crazy yeah no that that's
that's they are like the milky way is controlled by the kree yeah which is why it's like oh so is
there a crossover with the kree and the as guardian i don't know the emcee doesn't really
address that or at least it hasn't yet so not that they can now because as god has been obliterated
but hey don't get better uh mola sent you a meme several days ago search my name on twitter and
you'll find it don't need to play it today just want to make sure you got it uh i tend to go
through everything on twitter for the most part i want to recommend that anybody who doesn't get
their meme shown don't take it personally it could be that i missed it it could be that i also thought
that maybe it shouldn't be shown before whatever reason but uh if you don't see it uh if molar
didn't show your meme he it he thinks it's shit if he doesn't show your meme you can always i think
they're great i think they're great i would have shown it myself but you know getting molar to
give the okay on some of these things is like herding cats i'm pretty sure yesterday when we
were talking in private elish the only reason you wouldn't show a meme was because you didn't like
the person personally right no what if you've got a if you've got a personal issue with uh
with the person showing the meme if you don't show a meme that means you you hate the person
i hate every choice they've made in their lives up to the point where they made the meme
i know them 100 yes that's something yes what and uh yeah no like i said if if i don't if the
meme doesn't get shown don't take it personally but i don't show every single meme to everybody
because some of them seem sometimes some of them are a bit awkward and that's all this uh
but uh if you've only sent it once send it more than once um because i might have missed it
uh bucky take the shield sam i know i'm the perfect day to steve's legacy with a redemption
arc ahead of me but there was this one time in world war two where i didn't share my rations with
the no i don't know if i can say it because then i get in trouble what did they say negro
literally that how did you know that did you read it already it's like one for one what they said
no how like about is i'm so sorry something wrong with something you're like oh i can't
say that then is there no it's not it's not a bad word fucking are you kidding me have you seen
youtube these days well i mean no i mean like yeah they think anything's right well it's in my
interest it's in my interest to maybe steer it in a way that protects efap vaguely that's all no we
we don't support using the word negro like samuel jackson says but like in a in a term of endearment
he's like shit negro yeah but the thing is that alone can get you fucking banned on youtube for
all i understand about it which is why i don't condone it at all i don't condone its use at all
i'm just repeating what i've heard you're not allowed to use quotes except when you're allowed
if everyone was revived where they died does that mean the aliens that died traveling in
their ship came back in space and suffocate immediately yeah we we talked about this yes
yes it does that's what it means it's horrific it will be a whole movie going through every single
person who came back in a situation in which they would have died because they don't have
the technology that they had when they disappeared that'll be a movie they will make us realize how
fucking awful the decision was to snap everyone back in to understand the gravity of uh the hulks
move to snap we will understand that endgame was a bad decision overall that movie will happen
you should have ended with iron man one yes change your mind
where's part of endgame equals zero thematic resolution to the challenges posed to the heroes
by thanos principles in and ideology in infinity war trading lives willpower parents slash kids
all themes were wasted where they though because iron man kills himself to put everything right
technically which is the one thing they weren't willing to do in uh infinity war you know
sacrifice the individual for the many you could definitely argue that that's thematically relevant
yeah just remember the themes
but yeah uh something to think about pork eye and widow are still there though with no idea thanos
knows nebula probably just didn't want to leave them high and dry so to speak yeah but you can
still have nebula say hey guys thanos knows and then she goes back but instead when thanos is
lifting her into a ship she's like gee if there was just some way i could escape
right now damn well only better get captured
thanos winning should have been the end of the mcu i mean you know for your own personal canon
it can be it can be that's a dumb idea it depends is one bus full of orphans oh that was when i
questioned two buses full of children is one of them full of orphans that is a good question
oh wait what did you present a moral quandary i said yeah we had two buses full of equal amounts
of children but what if one of them was a bus full of orphans what is that really a moral quandary at
that point not really is it really a bus full of something then yeah they're not even are they
recognized as things i don't know and it's full of weight full of something i don't know what we call
stuff it's full of potential organs it's full of organ donors i watched thor for the plot well
the plot got thick in endgame yeah boy i was okay with tony dying because he was an orphan
technically yeah but if he was if he counts as an orphan doesn't everyone count as an orphan
not if their parents are alive once their parents die you're an orphan
so that means that everybody who gets very old is basically an orphan right yep okay can you confirm
this uh i am capable of it yes here i'll tell you what i'll have my top men work on this and
we'll get back to you basically i'm talking confirm it but he didn't confirm it he said he's
possible it's possible that he could do it i reckon he's a liar hmm okay are you a liar yeah
i've lied within my lifetime shut up rags infinity war better than in-game i mean like
objectively yeah that's what we agreed i don't yeah i don't think you have a actually a statement
necessarily i liked in-game more for purely subjective reasons but infinity war was more
solid objectively uh i was okay oh wait sorry he snapped away half the food too sorry what the
fuck oh so what the fuck the food isn't counted as living creatures is it i mean i guess well what
if you have a civilization of cannibals yeah they're upset because half the food is gone i agree with
yeah what if all the people are the resources so what happens then checkmate atheists drinker if
thanos's snap wasn't random but targeted a specific group of people it'd stop all aid going
to africa and the expansion of the globohomo capitalist empire preventing another population
homo if he was to do it specifically i wonder what he would actually choose
like if he was like get rid of all the people who are currently suffering like imagine that
i mean he was pretty um well i mean if he snapped up i mean would you rather
i mean that's interesting would you rather snap away all of the like the criminals of a planet
and the homeless of a planet before you snapped away all the people who were you know productive
members of society with jobs and stable families i mean you know what value that is the question
of infinity war but in it that endgame does not answer and that it's its main floor
i can headcanon the endgame mess because everyone is all happy dappy howdy doody honky dory in the
timeline alt thanos left well mostly maybe maybe i guess we'll never see it mauler is a bartender
the rum and coke you drank on stream with wolf was basic tell me what you have in your kitchen
and i'll fix you a proper cocktail i i usually just pick up rum from my local store and then drink
that so i don't really care for rum that much i'm pretty picky when it comes to my harder liquors
i just like spirits i'm i way prefer spirits that taste yeah rum typically tastes better to
me than a lot of spirits like for example i really don't like beer i hate wine as well wine tastes
like vinegar to me yeah i i like white wine but i do not like uh well red wine's okay but i prefer
white wine jay which do you prefer spirits and red wine
and that's basically all all i'll drink don't you know that red wine is blood do you drink milk
oh well i wasn't counting milk because obviously i well no it's not obvious that you drink milk
some people don't like it it's like if someone was like what gases do you inhale you wouldn't be
like air because obviously you inhale um what you're saying is obvious that someone drinks milk
i just ask i just ask it if you drink milk obviously obviously i drink there are people
who don't drink milk some people don't like milk i love milk come on come on hey you unaware of
vegans i mean i'm trying to become one slowly but you're trying to become a vegan why like
because i don't like the meat industry very much then just didn't just buy local stuff
yeah that's why it's like i'm not very strict on it i can i'm not like it's just like i try to
cut out as much like animal products and meat as possible but i'm not strictly vegan but i'm not
trying to get cut out more and more you say you want to become vegan like it's just it's
complicated like i want to become like fucking meat ethical and there isn't really a good word
for that that's not vegan so vegan is the closest just a normal person you just won't buy from
certain companies well like most meat producing companies though all right then just buy from the
minority companies and then like it's easier at that point to just uh buy fucking veg as well
like that's mainly mainly what i eat now it's just veg all right well since we're on the subject
what about the companies who produce vegetables unethically well i don't give a shit no god damn
i haven't looked that up have it because i've seen some of these you know some of these farms
that grow like zucchini and tomatoes and stuff and it is blatant overcrowding in miserable
conditions they got they've got corn and and rhubarb just squeezed into these little dirt boxes
kind of harrowing so i was curious what your stance was on it
but if you want to keep it to yourself that's all right
all right good talk say i fulfilled my destiny saved the universe and it doesn't matter because
of some weak-willed heroes who undo all of it because of some time travel bullshit i think
i'd be feeling a bit irked and one-dimensional then yeah like i said there is motivation for
him to feel frustrated it's just that it was more to do with the fact that it's almost a different
character i'm so happy jay is back on efap i miss his holy aura he brings to an episode also do you
still have the ihe recording about tlj wolf he does and it probably won't be released mauler
well i don't know i mean is there something that i hate everything can do to uh oh yes but i don't
think he would do that i mean i'd be surprised because not a smart move on his is half half
fair enough yes you know who knows mauler the blindfolded army in dracula untold makes perfect
sense everyone knows tix don't have object permanence all right and we close our eyes the
vampires to exist uh quill in infinity war one of the few people willing to make the sacrifice
needed to beat thanos feels guilty about it a messes up bigly quill in end game owie zowie
right in my infinity stones he doesn't get to do much in uh end game but you could say that for
black panther dr strange and a couple of others uh get hollywood superstar rich evans on efap do
you really think oh my god i would love rich evans i know you're out there and you can hear
me in the cosmic ether please please come on efap i don't think would he would dirty himself
such an action but i mean i'm not against it yeah rich you jack j mike all you guys
uh cinema winds just released everything great about captain marvel you know what to do gentlemen
we could cover that we will analyze it we can analyze it we can go through true true we've
been doing a lot of captain marvel stuff recently so maybe uh that's why it was kind of refreshing
to talk about tlj for a bit yeah uh we should have drinker on more often also more toss pot and er
please yes to all of them it'll just be a big rotation thanos knows who the avengers are the
unruly a-holes that keep fucking up his plans to save the universe does he really need to know
them personally in order to hate their guts for them to have interpersonal interactions with him
yes for them to just be like this bad guy and then bad guy to be like these good guys that yeah
that's part of why we really liked him in war was the uh personal interactions i mentioned in my
video i love the fact that he takes time out of his galaxy conquesting shit to go hey will this
guy who's in love with gamora kill her if it means saving the universe let's test that because he
can't do it because of my crazy powers with the glove but i want to see if he will that shit made
me really interested in in thanos the fact that he's testing people and i'd love to see uh back
and forths between him and those characters that are now in a position where they can defeat him
instead of him being overwhelmingly different versus this is the bad man these are the good man
if i and so that's fine it was interesting mauler i think you should check that star wars
gills twitter we uh we did and i again i will we will talk about it at the end as well uh thor
hammers say they be worthy he not he be worthy all hammers say they be worthy not he be worthy
i don't know okay the the thor's hammer is um gender inclusive
okay uh and they are people shit talking both tswg oh right yeah yeah on twitter uh drink is right
mark ruffalo had massive cuck energy i thought drinkers said that it was a good thing that ruffalo
was playing him not a bad thing i'll have to clarify i have a flight but i will watch the
recording and once it's released from warner brothers intrepid fingers i actually did try
to download it uh jane i've been denied the privilege so you were right about that
not actually sure of what i'm going to do about that it might just be that this efap will be
unavailable until we finally get it released which is unfortunate but what can you do uh i
would want thor to say something like i've already killed you once to thanos since past thanos did
watch himself get decapitated yeah it would be this is what i mean something like that would be
pretty cool i'm on board with that um have shad man on stream a lot of people have mentioned shad
man there's some content creators that we can't just summon out of the ether we do try it took us
a million years to get er you know i was an elusive person but uh i know once we got shadow
visti people will like get shad man just because one guy shadow varsity is our shad man yes
um not divisive molar it's a piece of shit i disagree i don't think endgame is a piece of
shit endgame was so disappointing i stopped liking movies after i watched it oh jay you're
being hyperbolic wrong the god of the sun you don't need to be so hyper
going to be a con of thrones on july 13th gonna meet the gilly gendry jamie brawn and
serial actors there we'll ask them to sign my coffee cup we'll try to post videos here from
the convention great i hope it's fun i know that a lot of tension surrounding the fact that dnd
apparently going to be there and if they're taking q&a questions that's going to be utterly insane
i cannot wait to watch that like i honestly if i was like the pr dude i'd be like do not go
like the universe just slip into the forest slip into the background just disappear lay low
upset a lot of people they'd be like no we didn't like fucked up the show that they really cared
about and these are the people who take time and money to fly out to conventions and they're the
people who care the most it's going to be exactly like um with diablo eternal that's what it's going
to be yes it will yeah someone will ask them probably with season eight and out of season
eight for rules joke yes uh i think there's still some of hulk's ultra chat personality
and professor hulk actually just more ruffalo bruce i see this as a total win but give it as
your show i i don't i don't see any hulk personality left in uh combination myself but
maybe there's something i missed i'll give the mcu another chance if they make a movie in which
tulsi gabot tucks me in pats me on the head and gives me a warm cookie and tight hugs all right
the mcu have been hearing about her all right but she wants to take your tax money and give
health care sleep soundly i don't uh that's uh she she's the uh the candidate right the
yeah the people like yeah a lot of people like she's one of the least defensive candidate
well i mean i just find the whole thing fascinating as an outsider the fact that the
political race starts several months like more than a year before the actual election
oh yeah that's a big song and dance over here it's fucking stupid just get it over and done with
three months four months you know that's still too long but
please accept my worthless aussie dollar reduce the toxic brood helped me get through a really
rough week thank you wolf will be pleased to hear that his incessant shilling for the
expanse has finally convinced me to stalk book one yay happy to hear that uh do a cynics next
plug you salute uh we are actually probably gonna try and get him on relatively soon because he's
back home now and yeah i've heard he's released a new video today so let's hope he makes some more
cynics next is there's more subscribers that that disgusting pizza um go check him out uh with
thor and endgame i would have had him traveling around the nine realms helping them and new as
god be a full viking style village but only a small percentage are as guardians i just i don't
know i think there's a lot of there's so little we yeah there's so little we actually know about new
as yeah it's it's almost just the joke itself like ha new as god there's not much beyond that
it's like yeah this is there's a society there i suppose we gotta live somewhere
shadow ones the name for the youngling shadows dads i think i mean i love had such a bad dream
that luke decided to kill all of his own students yeah that follows i believe in this narrative
i want a flashback scene that shows kylo accidentally killing every student in the
school naked gun style while benny hill music plays jeez oh man i miss naked gun it was so funny
i miss dead children uh i guess murdering students runs in the family yeah see it makes
sense thematically and consistent to lily lily mauler please no more tlj i'll super chat aground
i'm sorry it had to be done tlj is a returning monster it regains its strength every so often
we have to pull it out of our hands i still think luke is a fake planted by snoke to corrupt kylo
only to regret it after he succeeds it's the only way it makes sense we'll see with episode nine i
wish ryan johnson had been showed in a shoved in a locker as a kid and never found by anyone
but then he wouldn't have made tlj can't have that guy that film was great efap would have never
happened yeah that's the actual potential there do you want that guy founding father is ryan johnson
tlj starts ray gives lightsaber to luke luke takes it pauses then turns it on and kills
dumb cunt movie begins and luke is mc no wamans could have happened that would have been an
alternate story for sure people would have made excuses i wonder how much of episode eight the
next movie is gonna retcon i can't wait to pick my seat when i see an empty theater on opening night
i'm actually i'm actually very curious about how much it'll retcon that's something i'm interested
in for example fixing kylo's mask i love that they've confirmed that already that's just funny
they made a big deal about breaking it but okay fine just break it
i can tell that's cool robot voice how long have i been silent by the way because i just realized
my mic was plugged in it's a shame that j has been quiet for so long i haven't heard you for like
11 hours hear his voice in the wind oh no see i think i just heard it then uh the baby in the back
makes me laugh uncontrollably for some reason i didn't know i still had it in me to laugh at
anything that wasn't dark or edgy babies are adorable and they provide the the unknowanced
ness of laughs that's a weird by the way unknowanced inst
if you don't believe me that's a word you're a better another scottish person you should get
on is count dankula the legendary shit poster i mean i'm on board literally on board with any
guests so ray is the quintessential affluent white cunt who goes to college for five worthless
sociology degrees than works to destroy her nation with immigration all right then
i would have been happy to see fin die drinker is inarguably the most based guest on the show
i mean i had fun with him and i hope to have him back with drinks again i think he's a nice guy
he seems like a nice man i look we're four hours on the extended second part
if you realize most podcasts go for between one and two hours
that's the like podcasts for the week our part two is at least four hours it is we've
crossed with four hours and two minutes what if it has to be a part three imagine that
well then damn it we're gonna do a part three absolutely have you seen sarah z's bad media
criticism yes we responded to it in efap i want to say 20 it was starring jay longbone who is
another guest that we're going to have to have back but unfortunately we can't just have everybody
every episode sometimes we get six people and it's utter chaos i think that happens studio exec
hold on we can't kill both luke and layer carrie fisher hold my cocaine
what if it was akbar piloting the ship when layer or something was shown to somehow break
something or an engine that would also allow the stupid jump scene you don't need holdo
whatever you do you do not need holdo all right she is worthless that's my take you just don't
need it i like that they put her in though because if it wasn't her then uh what did you say you cut
off at i like that um i like that it was her that they gave her imagine them giving like her
dialogue to someone else and then they'd have to like imagine how how poor like akbar would have
been with that dialogue oh you saying that it's good that it's here because god damn it it would
have been awful to listen to any of our beloved characters deliver the shit that she delivers
yes yes but if we're suggesting
crypt fixes then i assume we would also be fixing the dialogue
hey yeah hmm um maula gives countless rational arguments why do we need holdo
wamans clear throat and throw up their arms because nazis
i don't remember them saying that in response but if you need women to defeat nazis
i'm confused by the circumstances of that environment but sure although parameters that
you've established are interesting although more like hold don't also wolf they called the 80 80
and 80 an attat in rogue one to how the alien with the big mouth calls it that that will really
upset wolf wolf was very upset when the trailer for jedi order they say an attat and i had to be
the one to tell him that that's actually done by a lot of people it's not uncommon i call it an 80 80
myself but a lot of people call it an attat he thought it was like well i call it an attast
then they call it an atst atst yeah and in the immortal words in the immortal words of rich evans
atst atst atst atst it's fine to call the at at the at at even if you don't call the atst
because they're two different things yeah i don't necessarily disagree this is the thing i don't
necessarily have a problem with calling it at at but i personally prefer 80 80
but i know wolf will be very upset by that when he if he ever listens to this he will pm both me
and wrack saying you were a bad an atat destroyed everything i hope you're happy
chad should join the fandom menace i imagine that we're all tertiary slash honorary members of the
fandom minute ray vis's captain marvel is like an unmovable object and an unstoppable
force clashing together it's impossible to tell what would happen they're both
unmovable objects and and stuff captain mom would win though she's i'm sorry i know ray's op but
she's not as op it's captain marvel like right or am i crazy yeah but she has plot protection
yes i i i agree with you the plot protection on both of them is so insane that it would be
interesting to see what happens i agree uh also mullet do you agree with game theory that infinity
war Thanos is worthy of Thor's hammer it depends on how you define worthiness because
a lot of people define it as like honest intentions yeah and that can be evil you could be evil and
you have honest intentions uh and you know like you have no intention of being dishonest whatsoever
in any way shape or form but it's complicated it depends on how you define what makes you worthy
of Thor's hammer because some villains are completely unaware of how they are villainous
uh so it's complicated but interesting nonetheless i like to talk about that sort of thing um i think
ryan was jealous of star wars and like a good sjw destroyed it rather than creating original content
uh argument can be made yeah so he thinks he was saving slash changing it for the better and i
would say that he's mistakenly destroyed it so i could believe that he thinks he was doing it a good
rather than a bad but if you were to do it a bad you wouldn't do much dissimilar from what he did so
all right i'm i'm sorry i'm gonna have to do it now i'm gonna die uh it's been fun being on i'm
gonna leave you're gonna die by the length what's wrong jay's defeatable oh yeah i yeah
come on jay what's up what's got you down bro i have to sleep or i'm i'm gonna sleep against
whatever happens i'm gonna sleep within the next half hour i may as well do it on my own terms
so it's been fun it has thank you it has been fun we've had a gay old time yeah thanks for hanging
out for a few bits and bobs you know just popping in for a few minutes thank you for that
hope you had fun jay it's just been like five minutes yeah just popping in just to have you
take on on that one subject or two yeah um enjoy your milk it's not real of course
snoppus good night can a flat earther well wield mjolnir
could you imagine they're like i'm right proven by mjolnir that some guy's like
it already means you think you're right that doesn't mean that you are right
so luke about that cow thing i'm not 100 short for those reference to other than how we should
be arrested for abuse the space cow has stockholm syndrome from luke yeah i agree with that
do you separate the artists from their art yes i don't think i don't apply that ever though i
will absolutely accept say for example i said i can't enjoy captain marvel because of brie larson's
comments if someone said maul that's completely like subjective that you're taking that on you
can't judge the movie from that point of view i'd be like no yeah you're right it is subjective and
i am acknowledging that just like how uh american beauty i really like that film but after what
happened with kevin spacey that film becomes extremely fucking awkward to watch considering
the narrative i don't know have you guys seen it i've not seen it no i know of it but i have not
seen it he is in a midlife crisis and he gets attracted to a young person and when you watch
you're like oh wow that's a little bit too real for me right now um so it can happen but if ever
i was to i would want to separate those things out i think that if you judge a piece of art from
what you know about the artist it can inform you'd still need references but then if you were to do
it completely separated like you're just like i don't like this person therefore i don't like
this piece of art then yeah that's that's on you got nothing to do with the art complicated uh
but interesting subject uh tlj is unironically proof positive of why women should never have
been allowed to vote a holdo toy well now i know what to give to my friend i know he sounds fucked
up but i'll be like the only reason i want a holdo toy is to probably set a flame and
they just be like wow that's violent i'm like no no no just i don't know just see the toy it's not
like a real person uh ooh can you see wait ooh say can you see by the dawn's early light oh
that's a reference the old american uh national anthem right star spangled banner mhm they should
change it so the dawn is mentioned throughout uh oh and by the power oh and the power went out so
i'm using my lightsaber to see right now that's where being a jedi pays off i could easily fix
stowels by re by writing episode nine i mean honestly i just think it'd be tough but uh i
think yeah i think it's possible i just think it's tough that's all extremely fucking tough and when
you tell me oh you know fucking jj's gonna do it i'm like gory will um the last day bender has
several mentors with arcs i did see a lot of people recommending that as an answer to the idea
that um well yeah bringy what's your take on this is it possible to have a story where a mentor
needs to learn a whole bunch of things while simultaneously being able to impart wisdom to
a student of course it's possible yeah i agree that's kind of where we were i i don't know i
don't know misrepresent critical drinker on that one but it did seem to be that his state his
position was you shouldn't have a mentor that should be learning shit at the same time as he's
teaching a student and we all said we're on the opposite end of that and then he eventually said
okay fine because obviously yeah you don't necessarily need to be imparting wisdom that's
while also being unable to learn i mean i wouldn't be comfortable in saying any character has stopped
learning you know what i mean yeah exactly you you're constantly learning also yeah bayouin don't
worry we'll save any memes that come in now we'll we'll save them for the next efab or at least the
next efab that shows me only the finest of memes there he has wonderful it's another one it's one
where wolf has eaten too much pizza and become a fat man he's a fat really love watching efap you're
so great molly you're awesome well thank you very much for the 99 dollars of dollary roos i hope that
this extended what was it six and a half plus whatever we're at right now which is four and
thirteen we need we've nearly beaten the record and i'm pretty sure we will by the time we get
through these events so yeah hope you're having fun with this absolute ridiculous insanitisms
harry dresden is a fairly reasonable harry dresden is a good mix of mental and hero
who is harry dresden from the dresden files i'm not familiar theories of contemporary
fantasy mystery novels written by american author jim butcher well this is the thing i don't actually
think there's probably a bunch of examples of someone who is simultaneously teaching people
lessons while going on a journey of self-discovery learning of their own right i think that's
i like to think anyway that that's something not necessarily uncommon because again yeah
i don't think there's a point where a character stops learning um there's always you always learn
and you'd be like oh so you never like understand fully what's going on in life it's like not really
no like if someone could learn the point where they're super old like you have a vampire character
like a billion years old and they've learned everything i'd be like maybe then but even then
something they may have learned when they were 10 years let's say 100 years old
may very well be completely outdated by the time they're aged 1642 you know what i mean yeah yeah
something that can happen and part of what makes storytelling so very interesting oh my please
compare luke and star wars in the first episode having in mind that the film was meant to be a
standalone not part of a trilogy with ray in episode seven but why that's comparing a character
to a piece of plastic slash wood why would you make us do luke is far more interesting and
a new hope than ray could ever be an episode change my mind
look at that fringian rags do not want to change my mind so apparently that's just ultimate truth
anyway uh luke has obi-wan and hardly uses the force at the end he's just a pilot he uses the
force because obi-wan tells him to and succeeds thanks to han and chewy agreed i don't like it
when people say it's a mary sue moment when he fucking manages to nail the missile shot it's
like the only thing luke does in the entire fucking movie outside of nailing the grappling hook thing
like yeah he did that it's like he shot the tie fighters it's like those tie fires weren't even
meant to stop them vader even says that he's like they're supposed to just convince them that we're
trying to chase them but we're not really so i just don't i fucking the argument that luke is
much as much of a mary sue as ray is frustrates me but i mention that frustrates everybody uh luke
was bad in tlj since the scene thinking of killing ban he treason everything yoda taught him a jedi
uses the force for knowledge and defense never for attack fear is the path to the dark side control
control you must learn control are you saying it's bad that he ignored and went back on every single
thing he learned what that's ridiculous it's totally okay that he did that regarding the last
efap her wolf gives solaris by isaac asimov ago fairly short sci-fi novel with quite a dream like
haunting atmosphere mary reading i will copy and paste ready for wolf to be able to read that i'll
i'll just send all this stuff to him once efap is over ruse which could still be another 10 million
years you know no the mum's gonna cuck him he needs father
oh thor i think next goliath video update my computer tismed and delayed me by a week it'll
be worth it though it's probably the most elaborate thing i've created and it's only a teaser for even
larger things all right plenty more memes on the way which is why we have to keep showing them
otherwise we'll get a backlog so big that we won't actually be able to have a podcast that's not just
meme which wouldn't be a bad log on my back um so the guy who made the uh the doom video he super
chatted saying super fun thanks for introducing me to you so yeah apparently that went that was
excellent that was a very very good video i think very impressive he'd be in sarcasmic aren't you
yep it's shit i knew it yeah i'm i'm i'm glad uh you had fun that's the important thing uh
logan was logan's story he's old this is true any story with an old shouldn't be told
like gandalf too old to be in lord the ring ian mccallan isn't just gay he's a kid diddler
i don't think that's a thing i've ever heard before never heard that old people in the new orphans
that's a value judgment is it better to be an old man or an orphan but what do you guys take
what fringy morally is it better to be an orphan or an old man i don't see how it's morally wow
you're a racist you believe this rags can you believe we're dealing with this i can't believe
it yeah i used to believe it i can't no lies lies you're gonna pretend i didn't hear that from you
jesus christ kill the past was actually kylo talking about killing the old yeah that's i
think that's what we're supposed to hello lord longman i wanted you to know what you
wait i wanted to know what you thought about kratos and boulder from the recent god of war
game as characters loved your book rags and wolf your fallout review was fantastic thank you i
spent a lot of time writing it learning getting my info together very important
so i don't know enough about norse mythology to know to be able to make a comment about it as
an adaptation for boulder but i loved kratos and boulder in the god of war game so i was planning
on doing videos on it but if i was to do that i would want to look into all of the arguments
why they're bad because i know that a lot of people don't like what they did with kratos in
god of war 2018 and um i think some people were upset with how boulder was portrayed so i'd want
to look into all of it but personally i really liked it i really liked that game i thought it
was awesome the old jedi academy game could have been three films
my mum's the kind of person who thinks the sequels are better she thinks the ot is boring and shit
but she thinks the prequels are and sequels are amazing well whatever floats your boat right guys
whatever floats your boat is it's pretty much the ubiquitous argument for anything
what so if you're in trouble and your boat is all that keeps you from sinking and something floats
it that's a good an ultimate good yeah pontoons they're good hey if that floats your boat
joining late have my money why thank you which is better 2d clone wars or 3d clone wars
i i can't make a statement on that i'll leave it to chat to argue 2d clone wars or 3d clone wars
go for it master shad there are too many of them what are we going to do you implying that shad
would kill a bunch of younglings how could you they're hack writers but how could you be so thick
affirmative action and ethnic nepotism mixed with a hatred for all things sacred and masculine
that is an explanation for the sequel films apparently this is a movie with space wizards
for children out of 10 yes that means it's immune for criticism is it too much for we've got quite
a mix between 2d and 3d oh is it too much to ask for you guys to leave a list of movies tv shows
and books referenced during the podcast on the description or a pinned comment uh probably i
find it troubling enough like a novel length yeah yeah and it'd be complicated because we it
would be like to what degree of mentioning like if we do a small reference or if we do a full
recommendation is like i don't know um typically if you hear me or rags or wolf or fringy or whoever
else say oh man i loved x you should check out x and do it at your own leisure like if you're
like man i do trust that guy maybe i will check out x um or if you go i don't fucking like the
perspective on what media is good i just like listening to them talk then i won't check it out
all for it if you wanted a list of recommendations that were full and complete from all of us it
would take you a million years to get through it so i don't know we all love our media here don't
we guys i i like media sometimes there you go all right it's all right i guess oh someone
super chad to say remind shad he is mute he was muting so that we wouldn't hear his children
complaining about the cages that he had created for the lack of feeding he provided to how how
how many super chases you still have if you're talking about because i hopped in like an hour
ago and i'm guessing these are in reference to things that were swapped about earlier typically
they slowed down once enough time has passed so i'm pretty sure we're up to like
shad had been here for about an hour at this point so no we're a decent amount in but i'm not
gonna say how long we have left in case some people decide to run away wait wait wait shad
is in australia yes and it feels it feels bad man that we didn't have fringy meet shad you know
that's a bad they they need the their brothers in arms they need to know that each other exists
so they can confirm to others that australia they're both they're just both gonna act to each other
they're both gonna lie to us
isn't that right fringy well yeah yeah you cracked the case see glad you but
i think shad did video on the snake fight did he i've been trying to go through his backlog i
don't remember a snake fight one but that um and baywood made art for that like immediately
did you see that wood rags i can't remember anymore um which one was this um i'd have to let
me go through my twitter i'll find it it's just the one where you're a snake yeah shad just chopping
the snake's head off yeah right why watching tlj was the equivalent of seeing a woman cackling
after messing up a guy's relationship with a false accusation because he rejected her what
what why is that your inference the film made me feel okay about wanting to glass people
is that the act of throwing glass at people yes
well you know uh the snakes are made of snakes true i have never i have never the lord of the
rings trilogy well maybe you should the lord of the rings trilogy i recommend it this is the
best efap so far in my opinion i that's like your opinion dude i don't know uh hi shad great
to see you back and congrats the chronicles of everfall yeah he said he's released that's been
released in two days from now i believe yeah you're gonna be reading that mr rags i can't read
i was gonna say that's pretty much my response like but wolf has said he would review it
how about that
but what if it's terrible oh god that'll be so awkward then we invite them on they debate
vigorously and then they become extreme enemies and we're just sitting here sweating the whole time
oh i don't look at this to the whole god please i get friend i get my wet paws on that one
then we decide you know fuck it efap is over we can't continue this too negative
criticism is dead wolf yeah we always knew it would be you thanks wolf bring you can
you get a message to wolf and say he's a fucking piece of shit uh uh yeah i'll get right on that
all right thanks much we always get out to you just out of context wolf's gonna be like what the
hell no he's like hey by the way uh uh by the way mother says you fucking piece of shit
so don't give him a time stamp you'll have to look for the entire thing
there's an important part on one of the efaps it was part one or two i forget
but uh he's like was i there for that you know i forget there's like five words he says one time
to you i don't know he said it was um ghost yoda spends his days going around nuking places that
have no books people make sure to always have a book nearby them to be safe from him
oh he's like an urban legend at that point then yoda kills you if you don't have a book
imagine if darth maul's ghost came instead of yoda's i would fucking love it it would be so
confusing uh what if he did the deed with the porgs that that raises a lot of questions
uncomfortable questions to say the least many of which we would not want to address on this
podcast that's that's my take on that if the x-wing can survive in space it can underwater too
like i said that logic makes enough sense to me but i could be wrong on that again not not a
science don't know the science of how air pressure space pressure versus water pressure and water
does the material against something works but you know maybe not what science gave us mauler
science gave us the atom bomb no they didn't pretty sure chemistry gave us that and that's
not a science that's a that's a that's a it's an art yeah maybe not function underwater because
of the engines maybe but you could totally write it so that it works that's kind of the point right
he's like you can't do it because it's underwater it's like how do you know that that means the x-wing
doesn't work that's up to the writers yeah and you could have just had the x-wing perched somewhere
with like dirt on it and grass growing and maybe some bushes you know also we don't know how long
it's been underwater again that's up to the writers they could say it's been under there for
a day because he moved it there because blah blah blah he had one of his luke moods which he does
now apparently he said no he's dead that's uh that's why blowfish nah shut it and nerd
that's in relation to the uh super chats i mean fishing super chats i don't i'm not 100 sure
it's raw raw confuses me something uh why is this guy ripping off er's voice and cadence
oh is he talking about this the guy we covered over 10 million years i don't really see if he
copied er i'd have to compare it but i mean you know some people talk similar lilies than other
other people choose as well i didn't really see an er clone in him but maybe i'm sitting around
giving rational arguments about why this film is trash is a virgin move do the chat thing and just
say it's bad because it's fucking gay well that's that i mean that that's one strategy
does it work typically though that convince people of your argument don't think so
why are you guys still talking about tlj episode nine is coming out
that is true we're only we're only months away from that now guys you excited
i i i just had to fill my pulse on my joy i am more alive right now than i have ever been
at any point in my life karmen electro question for shad what would be the best medieval weapon
for michael j fox mara cast don't count i understand that question but it would be
insensitive to michael j fox if we're here on this podcast with probably a flail would it though
you just shake that thing around he's not shaking it like aggressively it's only a little bit like
a flail's on him he's trying to kill someone with it he would be right maybe a rapier he's
like going quick cuts you know like you can't say rapier rapier
if the idea was to make something new and disrespect harm chewy layer and luke and acbar
do star wars six years after respect the law the universe the canon keep the traditions of jedi
lightsabers force rules and philosophy no because then people won't come and see it they got to
advertise it with with luke with harm and then kill them miserably that's how you have to do it
give it a choice you gotta give it in the door gotta get those butts and seats but with new
advanced technology amazing new ships advanced droids skin humanoid droids better warp jumps
better shields stronger and complex weapons at the dark side no that's not going to get people
to come see it you gotta bring in the old characters and ruin them about what luke did
on the island the entire time you know no lactation without insemination hope i didn't
give you historic ptsd as a britman lactation without insemination i mean those sea cows could
have been hanging out with each other you don't know i know the five stages of grief take time
but why are people still stuck on the stage of denial when it comes to tlj being terrible if
avengers infinity war in endgame wasn't a thing i'd have lost so much faith in storytelling um give
them time you know the stages of grief can last decades pretty sure science proved that too to ask
them i mean what what stage would you say on a meta scale would these people denial
uh not up to anger yet no i think we're up to targeting i think we are because like what you
have you cut out a bit i feel like we might be up to bargaining because we're up to the whole
well episodes nine coming out that's going to complete it you know i reckon jj's you know
he's going to be able to or is that still denial i feel like that might i think that's still denial
because bargaining they're not offering anything i don't know if this applies because like they're
i believe these people are sycophantic to the point where they'll never think that these are bad
ever well if if it was bargaining then they would say something along the lines of well
maybe if we're just good fans and we have faith in the series and we trust jj abrams then he'll
make a good movie for us if only we trusted him in support him that would be bargaining
but denial is still like no it's just nothing wrong with it in fact it's great it's not terrible
not only is it not bad it's the best one that's super denial
i sent a meme video on discord yesterday have fun hopefully we covered it if we didn't send
it through the twitters twitters where i get the moles j you don't like the vagine you like the big
penis now i think j has always been a fan of both he likes the penis and the vaginas he's he's a fan
of both and then a super challenge says hi rags
all right i was expecting more than that all right right so you know
just pretend rag said hi back my amazing rag my amazing rag you are amazing also hi j
um i would like it to be known for the record and this is all this is all being recorded
for future you reference that it was i who was declared to be amazing j was an afterthought
fairly worthy of the most simple and basic greetings true despite making only 13 of the
population dot dot dot and there's no additional message after that there's we can take that in many
directions he's probably talking about the fish nuns of the lj island yeah 13 of the fish nuns
are gay true that's called winning back to back on the same day i see this as an absolute win
i mean yeah but like i'm still upset by the fact that the other one won't be public for like a
million years and i can't even apparently the last time we got hit with copyright claims i was able
to download them before they were hit with it so i could edit out a good one but now i can't even
download the one that was been hit so we just have to wait and i hate the idea of us having to wait
so long that i can't even release the newer ones because otherwise they'd be all out of order and
you can't have that life sucks uh that feel when maula showed how duncuk was better than tlj
duncuk i think duncuk's better than tlj yeah i don't know remember when i got that though
you should have with a buy and critical drinker on an efap discussing star wars and fucking
millenials listening while i work tomorrow thanks for all your content maula yeah punk buster
no problem add commodore regarding decloaking military advancement exists yeah but it's the
funny concept of they run the decloaking scan and they find all of the baddies like why weren't
you running it and how does it work that you're immune to scans but you're not immune to scans
that are decloaking scans that just seems so fucking confusing
you knew you know we went over it uh can we all appreciate the j activated windows
yeah that's the character development that's an arc right there some people live their entire lives
without ever opening a window oh and this is like a response super chat military advancement does not
exist in star wars kind of seems to go backwards honestly uh it is not immune to decloaking scans
but it is immune to decloaking massives oh you want to see this coming if i were to iron man his
point i would ask why these tlj defenders don't just kill themselves because they like the film
why would they kill themselves they like the movie yeah ray gather round children today we learn why
a good jedi always votes for mass murder and child rapist hillary clinton to be president
i mean he spelled rapist r-e-y-p-i-s-t to get past the super shirt things i think
but what if they were referring to the character ray a child what would that even mean they no no no
they would also be a child rapist but specifically to ray when she was a child so it works both ways
i see if you ray praise a child you're still you're a child the rapist but you could
that's what it's for nearly forgot about shad this be for the swordsman okay so that's 10 for
shad as well i'm gonna have to uh dm him about that everyone's gonna be giving me their paypal
accounts today gonna be great uh chaff frillis has some pretty fun videos but yeah this is one
of his weaker ones um i think wolf said that he's enjoyed stuff from his channel so yeah i'm sure
he's made some good stuff that one like it wasn't the worst thing in the world it's just all of his
tlj stuff was just beyond you know again if he wants to talk about recovery faps all good uh more
money for more alcohol for more e-fapping wonderful guys you made a big picture of the gods that
sustains us guys you made it big there's an e-fap tag on i funny i don't know really what's my funny
i funny it's it's like a it's like a website for memes and funny pics sounds horrible i hate it
here let me go to i funny e-fap uh there's some yeah there's a there's some
i'm drinking and play steam sale games i love you oh thank you cow man coming soon dating sim
with e-fap cast that'll be pretty neat we would play it live on e-fap gaming it'll be horrible
though probably because you'll be living it's science fiction just turn your brain off you
must be fun at parties yeah that's what yeah you must be fun at parties is a really fun one to get
when you're trying to like explain how the plot makes no sense explain stuff wow there's a lot of
memes i funny for me fap yeah i'm gonna check this out oh my god yes our memes it was a bunch
don wick and look at all my tits
in quinton with his many photoshopped odd beards
i wonder if this is the source for um the e-fap dot me ones i don't know it's kind of similar
setup the three columns you know interesting if your area is too like you're completely
this super chat is for maulers fan the unofficial fourth member of e-fap
who's the unofficial fourth member of e-fap
uh anybody yeah i honestly i'm not sure who they're referring to exactly
arrival is basically a sub-par episode of tng quite possibly i've not seen the next
not so great debate gave me a brain aneurysm but in a good way right in a good way right
i'm sure they meant uh hmm has shadow visti ever played ex-an ex-anima the hack and slash
diablo game with an emphasis on physics based combat and detailed stats on armor i do not know
more senpai i know you have a lot of e-fap movies to edit so if we want to see them for a while can
you just say what they are uh doom with the rock that will be the the next one to come out once i
get to eve tapping it to editing it um and then after that i think we said it already in a past
e-fap but it's the lord of the rings trilogy which uh i'm very much looking forward to going back to
once i uh come with everything other stuff there so you got those four movies are on the way
there's one e-fap mini i haven't edited yet where me wolf and bringy are looking at the sonic trailer
that's gonna be late but it'll still be funny so and then beyond that uh who knows who knows
smaller a huge reason why the ot is better than the sequel trilogy is that the ot just is not
trying to be anything else and just flows so much better duke's death just a copy of a new hope awful
not so great debate guy is hilarious i agree with those statements jesus maul you went live
before i went to sleep and you're still here mad lads also hi rags hi hey hey if you go back to the
not so great debate video his name shows up after the first few minutes or so wolf had his discord
name on screen oh yeah we were just saying we couldn't remember the name not that it was like
a secret or anything uh mola we know you and wolf don't like tlj so i can safely assume you'll
be buying it when you're both 60 yes absolutely though there is so there is reason for me to buy
it on blu-ray for example and that would be the special features to find out if there's like
interesting elements to do with deleted scenes or commentaries or documentary style like production
things they can give me information when reviewing it so it's not like there's no reason we'd ever
buy it but the guy's reasoning was like why wouldn't you buy a star wars when we thoroughly
explained that we hated it efap 40 on bit shoot till cleared i don't even i can't even do that
it's currently out of my hands i have to wait for it to be cleared by youtube
the not so great debate guy's name is death in khan shows up briefly at the beginning of the video
there you go seven hours to watch a 10 minute video new efap record we break those records
every single episode records were meant to be broken yes i'm a love themes yet didn't understand
tlj at first i mean i got the overt sense from it with yoda saying the tisms thought it was
really dumb because so many of the characters do not follow those tisms or they break said tism
but my themes gonna watch later have a good stream guys yeah feel bad about comments like
that because they're gonna find that it's been it's been removed under the things of warner
brothers it's gonna be so funny for the guy who has to review it they'll be like okay what
automatically got detected oh it's a it's a video of the hobbit because apparently the hobbit got
claimed i saw the detail thing and it's gonna be discord far far away tlj defenders versus and
then all these pictures that are superimposed on top of the characters from the hobbit they'll be
like what the fuck is this like do you really want to try and claim the buddy from this i mean
they still would but you know there's no way it wouldn't fall into fair use um at the risk of
being hated on i had an argument on john wick being overrated and stupid and my friend said
it's an assassin guild movie don't look for logic i'm honestly wondering if no movie premise can't
be defended this way i think the first one makes a lot of sense i think the first one is grounded
um and you could be like there's no way an assassin could be that good i'd be like i don't know i
think that everything we see in the movie from john wick is relatively like a normal person could
achieve that if they would suspend their life as an assassin um and i'm pretty sure fringy and rags
actually both very much like the movies what are your takes how realistic do you think john wick
one to two to three is i think go ahead go ahead yeah you go ahead oh no you go ahead because i
want to get a bottle of water real quick all right no worries uh i mean john wick one is
the best one i'd say and probably is the most grounded because there are never points where
you'd think like oh nah nah you know come on like it usually is um it feels like it's something
that is attainable it's something that somebody could do um now in john wick three that kind of
they kind of push that to the extreme um i still really enjoy all of them but yes it's
considerably less realistic now than i think it was when it started um partly because i think
there's a pressure to up the ante you know to get more and more impressive with the stunts and the
fights and they're really impressive but it is at the expense of uh what would it be world tenuency
or well believability yeah yeah something like that
still really good movies though oh yeah though i think there was a difference of opinion on this
of these three people no yeah probably i imagine potentially all three of us stand in a different
position uh i don't know if it's been made clear previously but i adore the first one and i hate
the second one and i haven't seen the third one while you two i think both like a lot the first
and second and potentially the third one oh i like all of them but one's the best so i think
the first one's the best definitely the most grounded but i have seen the third one and i
like the second and i like the third very much but they do seem a little more uh a little less
realistic as time goes on oh yeah i mean like right at the end of john wigg three i was like
uh-uh nuh-uh no way without any spoilers another efap when i wake up for wick a welcome surprise
thanks to the content all you guys no pro blamo uh what are you all drinking tonight i believe
drinker was drinking jack and coke i was drinking rum and coke jay was drinking
does anyone remember what jay drags you know what jay said he was drinking i don't remember
i don't listen to jay so nobody listens to jay okay so jay was drinking there that is the answer
vulture was a cool character but the plot was so stupid i don't agree what is wrong with the plot
id hope coming yeah i mean i yeah i just don't agree either they said this vision of mj is not
mary jane she might be melissa johnson for all we know oh you mean the creator said she's not
mary jane well her name her name is michelle john she's not oh that's interesting yeah
that'll be a great argument for the adaptation comments then like it's not mary jane
well i mean it's effectively because i know and i can understand why they're upset still
uh mola she's and uh gleam it black should stop stealing redhead rolls i i know it's been pointed
out that that's a weird pattern but i mean can you really steal the roll from someone who has no soul
exactly homecoming was stupid as hell because they want you to buy the blue collar workers
can reverse engineer alien tech and not gain unwanted attention oh i did address that one
it happened over years and they stay under the radar and that they've been doing that's their
careers that they salvage uh stuff to resell on a market they prepped for it and the alien tech is
just another could you guys believe that if aliens visited that had rifles that fire shit
oh yeah i i think uh i think you'd be severely underestimating the capabilities of people when
they've got nothing else to do years and their whole thing is to salvage like yeah i can believe
that they can do something over a decent amount of time absolutely oh man i can definitely believe
it absolutely the chitauri is sufficiently humanoid enough that i got them they have literal
triggers on their on their weapons you know scarlet uh gohanson uses one in avengers to shoot one of
them so it's like so they're that close to our weapons like yeah absolutely i could believe
they could reverse engineer that when given that much time yeah like it's not this is not aquaman
where the guy reverse engineers it over a fucking night and creates a completely different piece of
technology uh aquaman blue collar workers aren't all dumb oh i guess that was a response to that guy
right now you guys talking about spider-man with spider-man's coming out that's that's a
thing yeah see now we're caught up these are the super that i remember seeing when i got here so
we still got another hour and a half worth of super chats uh so if i make an adaptation of lord
the rings and it was not like the books but it's a good movie is that okay i mean it was a good movie
right like spider-man yes but it would be a bad adaptation we we've actually covered this uh all
the way back when jay actually first gested the idea of being a good uh piece of content versus
a good adaptation they're two different things um for example hill house i adore that show but
the people who love the book hate that show because it has fuck all to do with the book
and yet it has its name and it steals a couple of character names it's like yeah i completely
sympathize with the people who wanted to see an adaptation of the book and it's a poor adaptation
it's a downright terrible adaptation but it's a great piece of fucking content it's just obviously
the maker didn't care for the book decided to make his own thing while stealing the name you could
be like isn't that bad i'd be like it's fucking disrespectful to the source content for sure
but i mean i don't know what else do you want me to say about that it's like yeah
there's difference between an adaptation and the content as its own thing
it's complicated uh the villain is great good hero movie has to have a good villain
i was a bit annoyed at aunt may okay what why though yeah why
uh molly your blood pressure also that was really scary don't do that again i think i got
bad at one point about the uh was it the fbi comment uh critical drinker said it was something
related to uh something related to homecoming i remember it i just can't remember the specifics
the one i remember is drinker said that uh the police never get involved with the uh the black
market dealings with the the tech and i was like the the big piece of conflict between spider-man
and iron man is the whole precedent of it is iron man saying he not only listened to spider-man he
got in contact with the fbi and set up the sting for uh thingy and spider-man ruined it
um so like not only are the of the lower level people getting involved spider-man doesn't need
to but spider-man's involvement fucks up their uh their approach of this lower level issue that
fireman was trying to tell him to stay away from what i mean the film isn't better written than
most people give it credit for um mola don't apologize it's so hot when you're drunk and angry
okay stop talking about spider-man homecoming spider-man is coming out you bastards that's
a fair point uh what's the opinion on into the spider-verse i thought it was awesome awesome
yeah it's fantastic i get around to seeing it eventually but i just haven't i haven't seen it
yet but i've heard i've not heard a single bad thing about it as well not everybody loves it and
for good reason it's it's top tier like it's really great not not only is a great great
film in general and super innovative animation style too homecoming is better than dude where's
my car yeah probably i haven't seen that movie in fucking ages uh dead almost blew himself up
with the alien core you can't tell me blue collar workers wouldn't have done the same
why don't know maybe they did net didn't know that it was going to blow himself up with it
it was a reaction to going through what was it like an x-ray scanner thing right
it's when it gets applied to radiation he didn't know that you could absolutely assume
the blue collar dudes would test it pull the technology that they have they're not average
blue collar workers the scientist duty has not that blue collar workers are idiots i'm just saying
that's the thing stop assuming they're really stupid the clearly vulture is not stupid
uh net uh sorry uh i feel like i'm behind in the curve on this but i wanted to ask did you
guys ever check out the jack saying eric taxon stream on efap 22 uh i only saw bits of it and i
thought it was really embarrassing and that it would really make for bad content for us to cover
on efap but yeah they did respond to it and you know what i recommend people go check it out to
see what their counter arguments are because do they actually make arguments my point was going
to be that uh if you wanted a reason to see how fucking lame and and poorly constructed their
arguments are go and watch their response to our efap is that the one where they ask for it were a
uh where jack saint begs for super chats no that's a different stream but that's just as funny
as someone who generally likes high tops videos his one on homecoming is pretty bad in terms of
presentation he had this this is my opinion twice in the vid while his other vids didn't it's really
condescending like i said we'll cover it we'll do a fucking we'll probably do an efap all about
homecoming because this is clearly a contentious topic that keeps getting brought up because for
submarines everyone thinks fucking terrible the rug we'll have to address that at some point and
that's a good video to uh go with because a lot of people think it's uh it addresses the problems
of homecoming uh no tony is not objectively the villain in the comic book civil war in fact cap
admits that he might be on the wrong side at the end all i can tell you is what i got from the
comic guy describing it he says well he told me but apparently during the comic series of civil war
that the idea is that they're on um the hero registration that's the story so you give up
it's the hero registration acts the idea is that um you it's incredible you become a sort of a like
you become a member of shield and you have to reveal your identity um does tony or does tony
not give up spider-man's name well spider-man does it himself because he like spider-man unmasks
himself to be like all right guys let's do the right thing and then they have a fight which
results in a casualty uh which prompts spider-man now this is this is a part where tony really loses
his mind spider-man's like all right no no more this and they fight like he tries to blow him up
this is the thing when he was describing the stories me i was like tony's the bad guy and
he was like yeah and i was like that's not uh yeah that's absolutely the bad guy he locks up
heroes in the negative zone in a it's like what and he starts recruiting villains to his side
to help out like venom and stuff i'm pretty sure it's like guys i don't know i don't know what to
say he's clearly in the wrong on this one it's not anywhere near as arguable as um the the
secovia reports is why i really like civil war i think that it's an ongoing conversation between
their two perspectives and the ending is less to do with that more to do with obviously their
personal struggles um i fucking love civil war that's my there you go uh still going praise the
long men all yes we're still going 6 55 a.m in britainia i hated homecoming because they never
explained how he became spider-man and who is the uncle ben so they don't explain how he becomes
spider-man because who the fuck needs to know why how he got bitten by a spider he just tells ned
he got bit by a spider the idea is that we don't need to spend several scenes like we already have
an amazing spider-man and spider-man ramy to show he gets bitten by spider it's not relevant
they want to tell their story he got bit by a spider it was radioactive are we done and then
he says oh can i get bit by a two and he says it's dead ned i killed it or something like that
it's all you need to know and then as for uncle ben if you remember he says why don't you tell uh
your aunt about being spider-man he says i can't put this on here right now you know what she's
been through and i thought it was a very tasteful way of trying to tell the audience yes uncle ben
is a thing in this one too but we're not going to draw attention to it because it's a story
that's well-treaded and we want to move on with our own story makes sense to me i think it was
handled brilliantly yeah i was actually impressed i was like oh my gosh i think that's a reference
to uncle bed they didn't even make a huge deal out of it to get that emotional free pass to be like
look uncle ben he's a nice person he died he's just sad about that they could have done it they
didn't they went their own direction uh i hope you saved the super chats when you reset the stream
yes we've been i'm now on to efap 41 super chats we're getting there folks to be clear do you guys
think that the pros ultimately outweigh the cons in avenger's age of ultron no no age of ultron is
a fucking disaster uh i enjoy it but holy fuck like that's a very little very little uh in the
civil war comic tony makes a subservient clone of thor who ends up killing a fellow hero goliath
and just brushes it off by saying it's how a cop would have acted screw the comic
it's funny to read after the one that said tony is not the bad guy
efap 40 through 47 how to redeem a broken last thordaman civil snake pole with a sword
that is a lot of references in one thing
they're making justice league part two but it will not follow the continuity of justice league
part one or bvs i've heard that about suicide squad i didn't know they were doing that for
justice league though so so it's not a cinematic universe anymore no uh winter soldier is based
because it's red pilled on neokons i didn't but fair enough millennial cs is any over 30 is angry
old man maybe oh millennial to be a what's the earliest age of millennial it's very broad
could you be a 30 year old and a millennial at the same time uh so a millennial is the
phase used to describe a person who reached adulthood in the early 20 in the early 21st
century and covers the generation of people born between 1980 and 2000 yes you could be
a 30 year old millennial and you could be a 38 year old millennial yeah there you go
efap episode 40 got copyright strike by winner yeah again anyone who's listening to this i'm
very sorry but you cannot watch efap 40 for a while until it gets released and i can't even
release an edited version because they snapped it before i could uh do anything about it so
again you'll be able to see this one because there's nothing that could fucking copyright
in this one and this will be accessible from the mauler channel i don't really want to upload it
on mauler before the other one because then it's going to be out of order which is really fucking
lame um we'll have to see what i'm going to do about that but yeah this one's watchable
the previous one isn't and that's a shame because it was a lot of fun but it'll be watchable
eventually because there's no way they'll be able to maintain that copyright claim
next time dr shad it will take more than children to save you i imagine that's in reference to
iman too had the governor talking about taking tony suits away because they were more advanced
than anything that had vulture's plan to stay under the radar wouldn't even last a week the
government would pull their resources on them they're under the radar though they haven't been found
iron man is extremely public vulture's whole thing is that they wouldn't find him and besides he only
starts years after avengers so in terms of timeline that still fits in in the idea that he hasn't been
found uh post iron man 2 because he wouldn't have started post iron man he only started post iron man
2 anyway um his plan to stay under the radar wouldn't even last a week that's not i don't
see why you think that's true who's playing the person said that uh vulture's plan to stay under
the radar wouldn't even last a week the government would put all their resources on them why what do
you mean the whole thing about vulture in the film is that he only does jobs that won't attract any
attention yeah at the end of the film that he does something that's very dangerous but it doesn't
pay off when it would have if not for spider-man hot take being fat isn't commendable or acceptable
and thaw was at his best when he inspired millions of guys around the world to work out and be healthy
sure dad articulation clearly not it's clearly not presented as a good thing but yeah
and ineffectual no i don't think so either uh shad manipulations are my spirit animal i'm sure you
would be happy to hear that people who know history i believe these corporations are actively
emasculating the population to stifle dissent soy boy okay alex jones elsewhere corporations
actively topple governments in foreign countries to enslave people
all right then no comment guys really no i don't like massive corporations controlling
things to stop dissent that's a that's a bad i agree that that's a bad but i do i do think
that the point of a lot of people on the left especially well they're very dismissive in general
and i think that you know calling people you know like alex jones and stuff oh you're just
a conspiracy theorist you're just peddling conspiracies that's one of their ways that
they used to dismiss people so they don't have to actually really talk about any actual issues
the next one says this guy sounds like downs rags i don't know who they're referring to when
they say that maybe it was jay maybe it was drinker maybe it was shad who knows a youtuber named
macabre storytelling thinks the departed is objectively bad efap him um so the argument
i've heard about the department is that it stole its story from somewhere else which is a fair
reason to say that it's um you know not as good as people think it is but yeah i'd be interested
to hear the argument regardless maybe he's right who knows i do like the departed a lot though
what do you think what do you guys think of event horizon have either of you seen event horizon
love it i haven't seen it i very much liked it it's a crazy film that's uh didn't pull ws anderson
direct yes he did uh not that doesn't mean it's terrible sam neil and lawrence fishburn in it
yeah and um jason isaac's is it as well it's a it's a cray film i really like it yeah it's worth
watching i think it's a great horror film definitely lets your mind wander for what the
fuck is going on i like it um and what's cool is it uh part of it inspired pieces of amnesia which
is my favorite game there you go maul is going to be sober by the time this stream is finished
i'm pretty much sober at this point i haven't drank now for the past few hours and back to back
to feeling normalism i think it's about time two strong females in the mcu learn to shut the
shut the fuck up they're not gonna captain marvel's gonna lead the mcu it's gonna be amazing
civil war it was a damn civil punch on
whoa yeah they punched each other you know in a warring environment guys and dolls parody rags
the dog it's just another day with rags oh rags the dog it's just a day with rags the dog that's
how that goes right if don touching a map is battery then a shake it is on my way to work
and sword dude just smash into a kia soul with his big truck i got out and helped the jig cost me
about 30 dollars of work and i gave the woman who was hit my favorite coat
good you're a bad person just ignore people in trouble uh if i've learned anything from captain
marvel she'll accuse you of assault because you put a jacket on her did uh didn't homecoming
start with the tisming of the mcu timeline yes civil so homecoming fucked up their position in
the timeline uh they said they were five years what was it they're five years after they said
eight years later from the avengers but yeah they're not well and i remember well the question was
asked did they fuck up or did the rusas fuck up but the rusas said well i guess that's up to the
viewer just like if you look at it i'm pretty sure the rusas established their timeline before
homecoming did they said for the last four years uh so yeah they they line up um i guess and well
that's the thing right because in civil war vision says in the eight years since tony stark announced
himself as i man so 2016 is when that is um but i've also heard people say avengers takes place
in 2009 that's what i've heard some people say i'd have to check but what i remember when looking
into it was the homecoming fucked up on that but it might be one of the all the other um civil war
was good minus the spidey stuff i love the spidey stuff in civil war so i will fight you yeah home
from sis's eight cleaned efap continues yes that last super chat from 007 was wrong that's all
uh that was the guy who said civil war was good minus the spidey stuff so i like how this
in fighting in the super chats it's funny um have you ever seen the 1981 film excalibur and if so
what are your thoughts on it i have but it's been ages since i've seen it another one with uh
oh no i have not seen that was it good do you remember being good i do i remember really
liking it i can't remember much about it though but because it's been ages since i've seen it
but it's an old obviously arthurian movie kind of dark but then again the legend itself is kind of
dark i read the ones in future king as well so there you go i would like to actually see it again
because it has been a while stories like these make me glad i got out of retail so that tells
you where we are that was what we were telling to retail stories we're getting there uh shout out
to my favorite artist the shad man yeah and people often ask us to get him as a guest and
that adversity and the shad man very different people i wish i could tell you guys my story from
target this is the thing when you work in retail you get like two stories per day so it's
infinite amount to here and they're all horrible they uh never worked in retail before but i
cannot imagine acting like this how do people think it's acceptable to make these wild demands
of service providers your parents have failed you that's part of the problem if they were to work on
the other end they would very quickly realize how unreasonable they're becoming or being and
that's why i think that everyone should experience it because it's seriously humbling and it'll make
you much more aware of how things work in retail let's just put it that way i am one of the most
patient people when it comes to retail shit just because of what i've been behind the the till so
i'm just like yeah you guys do what you have to do i'll wait and they appreciate it believe me
they appreciate rags i heard you grabbed a suspicious amount of women by the map how dare you
i did i took them on a trip around the world doesn't even deny it
the racializer guys maula watched all your videos on tlj brilliant rags you're the man you beautiful
doggo and when you're gonna when you're gonna dig non jtech tv again oh that's the name i haven't
heard in a while hmm i guess that's your answer well i mean i don't know i don't know he's been up to
i'd have to like i'd have to go to a channel like i seriously forget about these people they're just
such idiot losers i just don't even think about them but yeah after after this i can take a look
and see what he's been up to who knows who knows we could do something a little old school
anomaly ink said so far from home as well it's objectively not great
does that mean it's bad good yeah what's up not great could me um yes maybe have some money
thank you what is this continuous comments about liking something subjectively and have another
opinion objectively i can't see the logic here i'm assuming that's best yeah it's pouring
construction but joyed emotional level regardless uh j thanks for the gedel black video featuring
maula i'm sure he would appreciate springy you might think people should be able to agree that
minority report is a bad idea and maula you might think people shouldn't throw acid but you must
realize that pathos driven people are a large group
see the thing about like the minority report thing is really i don't think there's a valid
argument for it because it's like what if you're wrong i think that person is just
beaming but yeah yeah no i know i know but but there probably are people who look at my
that's a good idea uh you guys should watch the galaxy's edge review by cnet it's so cringe and
i think you guys will have a good laugh at how much the host isn't a star wars fan as we could do
yeah we could uh new lion king movie coming out anyone thinks simba will be like danny and kill
the entire lion pride after defeating scar we can only hope you hear a bell they do it
um i hope someone animates this skittles conversation you never know with efap you
never know skittles debate high quality content this absolutely has been my favorite efap you can
fucking i just i'm just trying to get to the end we're nearly there i was i'm actually like
partially excited because i'm gonna die soon uh skittles are better i paid money for this value
it more there you go rags you got a supporter yeah more you can do the spiderman origin in
the movie it literally would only take one minute it is bad storytelling relying on meta knowledge
what do you mean they say you got bit by a spider that was radioactive that's it yeah what more do
you need you could be like well they could have said what spider in which place like you don't
need to know those things i don't think it's relying on that knowledge yeah but spiderman
takes place in new york city and they don't explain they don't tell us anything about new
york city you know what kind of a place is this can you believe they're relying on meta knowledge
if someone said well they never say the words uncle ben so you're relying on meta knowledge
i'd be like no it functions whether or not you know the word uncle ben or the the tier or what
that is if you don't know anything about it then you know that they went through something and
there's no father figure in his life you can infer you don't absolutely i agree that you
have no idea what's actually going on there but it's more of an appeasement line for those who
are looking for that which is why i think it's clever the simult it works both for the people
who are just watching a movie and for those who are like hey i came here for spiderman's uncle
ben radioactive spider bite story where's my where's my slice of cake those pieces of dialogue
like oh uh we're not doing that but we recognize that you exist and we're doing something else okay
point you don't need to have the whole he's in he's taking photos we'll look at his spiders
we'll bury jade it's like hey take photos of his sabrabi movie you don't even do the same thing
god jam it oh and someone donated two dollars for fringy there you go i'll make a note awesome
um here's five bucks for fringy there's seven in total
why are you reading this spiderman is coming out i know efapping for eight hours how is your efapine
not on fire who said it wasn't last stream was blocked by warner brothers that's the thing
it's always on fire yep uh the last stream has been blocked and i've challenged it we'll have to
wait i'm afraid uh abos have 60 iq and considered human right sure what's abos abo i need to sleep
now this one's for the doggo love your rag in a very homo way also hi again j night guys fun day
i will add five onto for rags yeah here's some money don't give any to jay okay
okay here's some money for our manager he gets paid way more than us anyway
uh jay do a comprehensive analysis of hearthstone power curve he might actually after the latest
video great to catch you live i found you guys a few weeks back and i'm going through the back
catalog i look forward to hearing you read this around christmas well i hope it was as fun for
you as it was for us australia is atlantis but fake rags you eating chocolate don't do it
i'm not here's some money for jay fuck you jay jesus christ while they go through
game of thrones season eight made my anus bleed help there's not much we can do for you see a
local doctor you still gonna cover that brown table vid rags yes he is rags it was the most
surreal thing i was watching youtube and walking around my house when i noticed that everyone else
was too and not only that but we were all watching a different rags video kids too no way
molar and rags what is the order of creation for your content script record then video etc
yeah uh well we don't record and then do the script i was about to say maybe so if i was to
be a dick i'll be like how else could we order that uh but if i'm going to be as best intentioned as
possible so i have an idea i write out notes and then i really go crazy on notes and then i
turn all the notes into a script then i read the script and record it edit all into a video do
multiple read drafts to make sure i get everything i want in there and then roof and and print what
is your process rags i don't really have a process um i will say that i don't generally do scripts
like i might do a paragraph maybe but that's pretty uncommon if i want to do something that's
really structured like maybe like the the fallout review i did for the most part script that but
when i read through i ad lib a lot as well but it's mostly just so i don't forget like certain
points in it like like game mechanics and things of that nature or i don't forget examples that
i have footage of what about you fringy what about your newest video that you're making
uh oh what do you mean the one that doesn't exist um the one that you showed us and you promise to
release to your beloved fans now that's i've i feel that's a lie uh oh we can't lie nope
it's under contract we can't lie i don't know i mean the process starts with the script doesn't
first and foremost i mean if there's a script it'll typically start with one yeah well that's that's
the most important part like all the visuals and the editing is all it's all sort of in service of
something that's not a piece of shit script uh that's my view anyway uh i still haven't got
trout but i did get the new ss jansen from the new diamond packs please send refund for my hit and
run donation looking forward to hearing this in four hours 433 gmt ula refund for my hit and run
donation i have no idea well that's a reference to i'm sorry no he's he's swooping in and he's
giving us money and he's heading out for all right j hang out with dankular and become a chad
there you go j my biggest problem with spider-man was you wouldn't understand it unless you watch
all the other mcu movies stock cap etc movies should stand alone i disagree the mcu doesn't
have to have movies to stand alone because the whole premise is you're watching essentially a
tv show of movies uh but homecoming is still absolutely as followable if you haven't seen the
other movies what do you guys think yeah i think so well yeah absolutely it's serialized
it's um i kind of understand it'd be like saying man you know season breaking still on its own i
shouldn't have needed to watch seasons one through three to understand season four
yeah and then i would question also if you were to say a film should stand on its own it's like
should all so return of the king does that stand on its own pretty confusing to watch imo i guess it
does but like yeah i would imagine it's no i'd be like it's more confusing to watch return of
the king out of sequence than it is to watch homecoming out of sequence imo yeah i'd say so
uh ps problem with civil war zemo's plan is over complicated where he needs psychic powers to guess
people's reactions that's only if you assume that what happens in the movie was what he definitively
wanted that's a lot of the thing that people say it's like the exact outcome in the film was all
that zemo wanted it's like no zemo could have had a lot of different things happen the main thing
the main interest he had was splintering the avengers and he was going to do that by revealing
to iron man that cap's best friend was the one who killed his parents uh how it was discovered
was a bonus as far as i can tell from the movie zemo's initial thing though was just getting proof
um didn't necessarily want it specifically that iron man and cap are gonna have a fight
to the death at the bottom of that fucking place that's just how it turned out
will they ever reuse thanos or does the mcu consider him permagon i imagine he's permagon
i would say this is for rags for that brilliant vegetable farmers question
oh
you're up to 67 72 dollars i'll be sending away ranks damn we need the efap are you sure we don't
have to wait a whole week today what did you say you kyle you said we don't we don't have to wait
a whole week to do another efap we don't know i just i feel awkward about the whole way releasing
them awkwardly i'm hoping that we get that thing passed through every day um i am having an
unpositive day my dudes i hope you boys enjoyed the dawn's downfall because i was asleep when you
watched it feels bad man you won't be able to see our reaction to it for a little bit of time
but it'll be there eventually once that video gets released yay vegetable farms genocide small
mammals and ground nesting birds by the thousands just so you can eat a carrot source i'm a pest
control technician that works with several farms gg well played i don't know if that's true or not
guessing you guys don't eat hmm well this is a little bit out of my area of expertise
i don't know if it's a meme or if it's like a bit of harsh reality being spread i have
uh if tlj never happened would we have people defending game of thrones like they do tlj would
that be the thing that breaks writing yeah i think so if tlj never happened game of thrones would
have been the big wake up call probably uh but tlj already happened so game of thrones i think
people were more ready to be like yeah this is just fucking terrible uh what if chad hulk comes
out when professor is intellectually exhausted would that be a good compromise also best place
to tickle efap is still present best place to tickle efap is still present i'm not sure what
that means but um what i would have wanted is that the personality is um he's a he's a very smart guy
but he's quick to anger i suppose is the best compromise you could have between banner and hulk
but again that's not necessarily what i want anyway i want to see them uh i want to see the
duality i want to see them fight each other and talk to each other and figure out their problems
instead of just skipping all of it and being like oh it's just big banner wrong banner now
i just got here what did i miss you've missed five hours and 19 minutes plus six hours and
30 minutes of dream oh some stuff um i've had objectivity talks on reddit some get it but it's
become clear to me that those who say you can't declare elements of art objectively
bad are either fools or delusional which upsets me as somewhat modest person it's a complicated
discussion and i said i remember saying to jack long before we covered his video that it's going
to be an ongoing discussion that'll happen well after before i was alive and well after i'm dead
and he saw that as evidence of how um it's a faulty notion the fact people will discuss it
well after i'm gone i was just like uh people will be discussing whether or not the earth is
flat well i'm after i'm gone too they will always exist a lot of people out there who are funky
are you human i saw this late morning and it's still going no i'm not human
no i'm not a human now the next one says hi rags hello you guys are still here is this a
24-hour stream nice no actually but this is going to end eventually 40 congrats on your
fallout 76 video keep it up 40 40 40 maybe 40 a oh yeah maybe yeah yeah yeah um i am also in
australia oh there you go meme repository is apparently from a fake place that's cool
on the subjectivity crowd i remember sof year in college ivy campus supposed to be smart chatting
with friends about film and one chick kept dismissing everyone's criticisms i probed her
and eventually asked if she believed standards shouldn't exist he probed here oh my god on
college campus i probed her and eventually asked if she believed standards just shouldn't exist
and she actually said yes that's when i realized women shouldn't be allowed to vote man this is
like the fourth time this is it's the same dude um as an australian i can confirm that australia
does not exist the script writers were terrible who thought emu walls would ever be believable
yeah i know it's dumb but what can you do some writers think that it is believable
anybody with a rational brain you know the rags has given me crippling depression for
not saying hi back to me i think i've lost faith in humanity also how did i not say hi back to you
there was one guy you didn't say hi back to you oh goodness well hello i didn't mean to not say
hello i must have just blanked out for some weird reason his name is ashdam ashdam hello ashdam
hello ashdam bringy say hello ashdam what the fuck
what oh my god he's gonna be so upset hello efap keep me company while studying also high rags
hello this efap is so long i made another meme video during part one sent you to on twitter
it has the dawn by the way make more super chat folks get to 12 hours i know it's wind near the
end this is actually a leaf hey man we'll be able to unlock efap 40 unblock efap 40 sorry and yeah
as soon as it's possible youtube is a bit of a dick like that i wish it wasn't held
hostage i can't even access it that's the really sad part because someone suggested um in a pm i
think it was southpaw actually that you can cut out the offensive quote unquote part the part
that's a copyright you can't do it um that's not an option yet for me all i can do is counter the
claim and when you do that it's like why are you countering is it because you own the content is
it because it's fair use i choose fair use i have to supply a bit of reasoning for why i do then
you have to sign and then you just submit and that's all you can do it's terrible because it's
literally near seven hours of what we would definitely refer to as content where we're
responding to all the things our fans have done as well as commenting on videos and responding to
them and it's all really this is a good efap and no it's locked away until youtube realize what's
going on it's like annoying so believe me we want it as free free as fast as you guys do it's just
that we're gonna have to wait uh high top won't mind debating he's chill and was debating
sure we'll check out his video and if he wants to come on efap afterwards we would welcome it
finally got to watch an efap stream and also homecoming is good need to rewatch it again later
after work that's yet to be concluded we'll have some kind of very controversial efap over whether
or not homecoming is a decent film uh great pics you've been dropping in the discord today rags
oh you bet my dude always happy to help always happy to share the bounty
uh ben is the dawn's real he never fully recovered from his injuries and died shortly before the movie
and then the final super chat is fringy why am i so flaccid
oh i don't know you might need to talk to your gps what's your gp a gp is a general practitioner
it's a doctor oh does the gp help you with your pp well the gp helps you with all sorts of things
including pp yeah he said it yeah no i did he's aware of that uh which brings us to the end so
um extreme thanks for all of the generous donations i will sort out getting everybody's
specific ones to them i'm just gonna have to collect a lot of emails i suppose um and the
extreme creativity in both the images and the videos for the the memes and obviously we're very
regretful that 40 has been nuked for now it'll come back and i hang on to the link you've got
right now it'll be in the discord as well uh for my community but i guess people who ask on twitter
i'll try and supply it as well access this shit from the mauler channel unlisted for now it'll
all come on moolah hopefully i'll try and contact the youtube support thing see if we can get it
sped up in terms of releasing episode 40 i don't know what they're like with that but we'll see
and yeah appreciate all of that unfortunately though i don't i don't mean to finish on like a
depressing note or a bad note in any way but this it needs to be talked about uh
that star wars girl's sister was missing for a while uh i think near a week um unfortunately
she's turned up and she's passed away i have no idea what the uh specifics are you might be able
to find more on twitter but um there is a gofundme setup to support the family dealing with
what is i imagine something horrific and again it may seem very strange to put this on efap but
the fact is like you know she's she's a friend to a very certain degree and uh we'd like to
obviously talk about it and at least raise some form of awareness so it'll be in the top of the
description uh a link to this and i'll pop it in chat in a second it's uh an ugly situation
it's unfortunate that it happens and obviously the our thoughts are with them uh the family
and it's fucking horrible it's genuinely not not not a good thing that's happened and and yeah
it would just uh hope that everyone can sort of you posted the gofundme link in there yeah i see it
yeah i'll post it a couple times and like i said it'll be the top of the description
and uh i'll pop it in my discord announcements as well yeah
yeah uh again like i said i don't i don't mean to try and like
download it's just it is important to talk about uh these things happen and i just want to make
sure the information goes out um but other than that is is there anything else you guys would like
to say about anything in any way uh no um i think i i think that covers about all the bases we've
been going for a long time and i think many of us are ready to i guess wrap things up conclude this
saga yeah i believe is the longest uh efap has ran and again like i said it's just it's a
ridiculous thing it's an entire adventure and it's just really like i said it's unfortunate
all this that shit happened in the middle of it but we everything has to be done in a way
that's respectful so i'm hoping that um everything sort of gets gets where it needs to be this is
very uh impossibly difficult to say the correct things in situations like this i just uh
supply that star wars girl anna with um any support that she needs and um other than that
yeah thank you all for uh every kindness that you provided for this community and hopefully we
provided uh what you were looking for back and all these things will be made available as soon
as possible that the streams and um everything else but other than that uh have a good morning
afternoon slash evening and uh we'll catch you guys on the next efap which i'm gonna say is
we have no idea when it might be but hopefully soon and we'll see you there
so goodbye everyone goodbye
