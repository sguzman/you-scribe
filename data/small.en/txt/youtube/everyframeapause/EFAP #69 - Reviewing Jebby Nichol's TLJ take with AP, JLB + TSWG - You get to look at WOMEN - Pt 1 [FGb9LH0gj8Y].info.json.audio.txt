internet who is getting off on that though you know that that's the worst part
the fetish is coughing like yeah i love it when they cough
cough more into the microphone do it because i'm coughing in between every
other sentence i want to hear all the flim in your throat
it's like nose come sir please we're setting the guests
all right i'm fixing chat don't worry chat and chat is being fixed chat gosh
chat so aggressive
man fixed chat i'm doing it right there you go you are now the character on the
stream that's how it works and the thumbnail is fixed it's all good to go
oh and so good at this you see me like five minutes now i get it done in like
30 seconds so i so unposted a picture of this tweet
that thing is pretty nifty i don't know what to fully think about
it though uh we got someone saying lowkey i want
ryan to just die already so people will finally give him the respect
what does this person loves him or hates him
i want him to die so you'll get respect he just
oh my god what a strange thing to say miss daddy ryan a martyr
oh my god what are we that's yeah that's probably the most bizarre way of
supporting a creator i've ever seen i hope he dies but for a good cause
well you know martyrs live forever yeah okay this this little video is is funny
what are we looking here
emergency lockdown initiated
where the fuck even
that's uh that's fucking bam of his soup bed right something like that
yeah yeah it is it's like one of the only decent scenes of that film
where bad man just needed everybody
bismuth you made that probably thought that phasma was a character that was their mistake
oh well they learned what's it's crazy because a lot of people speculated that she would come
back for rise of skywalkers like rise of skywalker doesn't even know she exists
like that film just completely forgot about it i completely forgot that she died at the end
most people do because she died twice it's confusing as fuck it's like oh wait this
character again okay this is like an everyday thing for you this is something you could say
about the the sequel trilogy death just death's a concept that's very flimsy in the star wars universe
trilogy would you remember when when uh uh the force makings uh came out and they they really
push phasma like there were all kinds of toys and stuff but all this is gonna be this epic
character is gonna be in everything well there's that interview where she says captain phasma is
a boba fete style character it's like what does that mean i think she meant that you barely find
anything about them you just see them they're cool you're like oh i feel really bad for kids
who got captain phasma figures what if people like name their kid phasma how do you think about the
thousands and thousands of children that are named calisi or or denarius just don't ask where
that comes from like where the kid's like what'd you name after you're like oh you know nothing
just hitler well we had uh someone on who did tell us that the world was still a better place
with denarius rather than without it so what do you have to say to that
that was a painful stream to listen to yeah well i mean you know everyone's entitled to their valid
and equally accurate opinions okay that's how it works even when they're wrong when they're
hideously wrong poor king's landing how long is it going to take to recover from that
i've just moved to a different city at that point they're in medieval times too like that's gonna
take ages are you gonna go the next city well you say we could move it's like who's gonna move
everyone's dead anyway it's gonna be like a few corpses crawling away it's a buyer's market for
real estate man you have to worry yeah plenty of free real estate well always looking on the right
side i see i feel like nobody's not gonna have a job because so many people died that you know
workers are in high demand at that point i would just go to there's no one to pay the people who
are still alive oh that would be a thing plundering that place there'd be all kinds of armies goodies
go inside there's no defenses on the main castle there's got to be like a
like a room of gold or something get in there folks
for those of you who are left obviously
so yeah that leaves us with efap number 69 it was actually planned game of thrones episode yeah i
was gonna say game of thrones making it back into the discussion people i've seen people speculate
it's like you gotta do a game of thrones episodes like uh at this point we'd have to find some kind
of like tismy video to cover it because game of thrones is pretty much dead forever now right
until george martin releases the next book but i i am very much of the opinion that george
intentionally set dnd up to a degree to get people to come back and read his books again why i i feel
like he did it because i know he's kind of a sniveling weasel and i i just feel like i don't
know if it's gonna work though for you george because you made everybody hate the ip was it
really his fault i don't know how much it was according to that one guy oh yeah uh fuck who
was was that was that yesen as well i can't remember who i can't remember what was him
yeah some people think that he it was all like a setup but i mean as far as i know he told them
about the ending and they just did whatever but i mean i think that you know in retrospect a lot
of it again was because they thought they were going to get the star wars ip and they were just
like oh fuck this um however we know how that turned out yeah they've dropped that now too
probably for the best i don't see that happening well yeah they get murdered
but hey that was in a pretty good position too right it's all going great yeah um so yeah this
is this is efap 69 we we had no idea what to do other than just you know decide we made it our
most diverse episode ever four females and a male how's that what do you think what do you think
man oh oh no that's right right i'm the bat and uh yeah so you know no one can say efap was uh
male dominated in some kind of disgusting misrepresentation um and you know we're even
going to be covering a female creator today so as in in the infinite words of major lee
you do get to look at women in this stream and that alone is enough of a positive right
that's a thing he said you might get blocked now finally mauler i'm gonna get what world
from jenny you might finally get blocked oh no oh yeah that's true actually well they can't
complain this time though because we have females on the on the roster right like they're not allowed
to complain i think we can still i think that the the thing is that if if women do say anything
then we're self-hating right well it was worth a shot i guess oh well um yeah there's uh there's
there's not much in terms of catching up or or announcement stuff uh doom went back down
only to come back up as the efap movies because it's just is there for as an asshole um that's a
that's a battle it'll go on infinitely speaking of infinitely part one of infinite crisis came out
uh two is on the way as is three and four and five in fact rags you and i are watching four
and five tomorrow yes yeah we are we're gonna watch four and five tomorrow we're gonna keep
up with the riveting story of all of these characters and there's their story and the
things and whatever the fuck is going on in this universe and then uh i think it's like a week from
now or whatever batwoman kicks back up you you excited yeah wait did it it gets a second season
it's not well we've got 16 more episodes of season one and it's got a season two oh jesus
just infinite entertainment folks all kinds of everything on infinite bat women how do you go
from how do you go back how do you back from you go back from saving infinite earths like the
concept of reality itself you have rescued and you go back to catching criminals in an alley
and it's alice as well i'll be wrong with you on something i'm a huge fan of batwoman the comic
book character not whatever this shit is i haven't seen it okay no you haven't seen it wow no because
i like batwoman why would i put myself through that torture i actually why do you hate ruby rose
what's what why because she hates lesbians no i i very much like lesbians being half of one myself
but uh there's there's a story that happens in the middle of the jh williams um i run on batwoman
where like there's a tie-in with wonder woman where it goes full love craft and like giant
tentacle monsters invade gotham and it just manages to come back from it it's great it's
fantastic it's wonderful and then it got canceled by dc guess guess what because dan didio said
that no dc characters were allowed to be married and he canceled batwoman's uh marriage to her
partner that was back in 2014 2013 so oh how things have changed wow well do you know what
some of the biggest like payoff of the first set of episodes of season one were um there was a guy
in a restaurant who said that he doesn't want to serve gay people and so she built a gay bar next
to his establishment oh fucking you're kidding me there were people in sitting there were house
wives sitting at home who were so woke going you go girl yeah that's that's batwoman what an amazing
show she just showed him they are so invested in the the shallowest show please guys read the j
i would say it to the audience please read the jh williams rod on batwoman it has amazing art
it has good stories and it doesn't like shove this horrible crap down your throat it's actually
well written god damn why they have to do my girl wrong like this there was uh there was a tweet
talking about how like men don't like the batwoman tv show because men want like villains in their
heroes and like referencing stuff like iron man i guess um and it's just funny because batwoman
out of all the shows and movies and stories i've watched about superheroes even anti-heroes like
she's one of the worst she lets a lot of people die um yeah she's horrible i think one of the
best examples of sort of highlighting this this attitude from here is that there's all these
people who have just fallen from like a runaway elevator just crashing into the ground they're all
scattered out in this like lobby there's blood they're like screaming and then a batwoman as
kate kane walks past them all to go home and put on a bat suit and then come back it's like maybe
you can help she didn't get no mauler she didn't just put it on the bat suit that's when she
upgraded it with the hair oh and she gave it a spray yeah yeah she didn't just put on she
didn't just go home to put on her suit she gave it a makeover it's terrible right daredevil yellow
does this in daredevil yellow it's shown that like there's a scene where where daredevil is trying to
he he and the owl fall into the into uh the bay outside of yeah outside of new york and uh and
he can't i think it's a daredevil yellow and he can't save him and it's and he like thinks he
dies and there's ways to do that really when you talk about street level characters who don't have
infinite power but going home to go put on your makeup uh bro what are you doing well yeah it's
like wow that's that's what you got for a female led tv show you're like she has to
just just to do that before helping people oh okay women empowerment she has to go put on her face
oh it's so i feel so empowered right now um but yeah uh so that's awful everything's awful
we were just talking about how everything's awful um what was it dr who jay was letting
me know that uh that's that's going real well what was it seven percent that the rotten tomatoes
has dropped to six six now oh my god well let me take a look see rotten tomatoes doctor who
so we're gonna oh no this is not the right season they're trying to they're like they're showing me
the not current oh it's up to eight it's up to eight percent however it's up to eight percent
after significantly more user ratings but the critics love it what a shock good it is i'd show
you show you a picture here of our rotten tomatoes thingamabobber yep yeah that sounds about right
eighty percent uh uh by the critics and eight percent by the audience seems legit i think
that's the biggest difference i've ever seen that might be that it might be yeah because even
batwoman was like in the teens this isn't even double digits that's fucked up the question is
how much money do they have to lose because they are still making money on this shit and i mean
with okay with bbc shows in particular there's an issue because everyone has to pay for a tv license
right so people kind of get charged this money no matter what if they want to watch tv to fund this
garbage but like how much money do these companies have to lose before they realize
this probably isn't a good idea oh and have you guys talked about the new captain marvel writer
because i have a lot to say about kelly sue daconic oh we can we can jump to that if you want i just
want to say space for all what a strange tagline space for all that is a oh i didn't even notice
that fuck off oh my god space for all eight percent also jay wants me to read out the thing
that i was telling you about guys about earlier so this is apparently from the newest episode i guess
um the doctor deliberately tricked the now brown master into getting captured by the nazis so he'd
face their race hate he wasn't even doing anything evil at the time it wasn't a solution to anything
he didn't stop his plaid or anything it's just something she decided to do yeah they got that
cool this is very in line with the doctors that's that's very doctor-like that's that's something
the doctor typically does throw people to the nazi yeah well yeah uh yeah so captain marvel
2 is apparently being written by um who do you say daconic what's what's what's your take on
on this person because i don't know anything about them i don't think okay so i do i've read
everything she's ever written for for marvel and dc and for um image uh so kelly sued iconic is
somebody that i actually thought had some talent she wrote some pretty good issues on aquaman they
weren't fantastic it's not peter david but it's decent she wrote four issues on ghost which is a
very good series in general but they weren't fantastic for issues she wrote a mediocre um
indie series called pretty deadly and astonishingly i i saw an article that was written about her
regarding her being the the writer for captain marvel that described her as i quote an uber
feminist all right that's a good sign and she yeah she wrote a series called bitch planet which
is literally oranges when you black went in space it is about a plant a prison planet for women
it's actually readable i it's not complete i mean it's not good but it's readable and however
despite the the the niceties are just laid at kelly sued iconic and said that i thought she
had talent if you want to know where the trope of carol manvers comes from she is the origin
she 100 invented the idea of captain marvel as being a man-hating horrible just insufferable
person and that is 100 like sued iconic so of course of course marvel would pick miss disney
would pick her to write after marvel too yeah that's who we got is is the woman who wrote bitch
hmm well um i think we can expect that captain model 2 will be fantastic oh
something that's just reminded me of it like just uh when you know that the writer is going to be
injected some stuff into the story you i'm assuming you guys have heard about everyone's
very upset with uh patrick stewart's comments recently about the card show he said he said
something like it's gonna it's gonna tackle like the the evils of trump and brexit or something
yeah i'm i'm curious i mean like star trek always i as you guys know i'm a big trekky
more than i am a star wars fan trek always uh you know discusses uh he's big stuff
no she's well actually they're they're related languages close enough
twilight is what she speaks yeah twillock
but uh you know treks always discuss political issues uh but guys really it's never been this
overt and i'm saying it's never been this overt and i'm comparing that to the original series
episode where they couldn't discuss race issues so they had one guy's hat his right side of space
painted white and the left side of space painted black and then vice versa and had them hate each
other and it's never been this overt thanks guys appreciate it yeah well we'll see they did it
well we'll see they did it with you know other races excuse me like alien races so that because
they live in this idealized universe and so when they do it and they deal with those kind of issues
it's always with aliens because they've already been able to overcome it i saw part of the article
where he was saying that he didn't like that it was too safe and i was like that that's the point
though is that we already were able to overcome that as a species that was one of the greatest
things about star trek it is i was i've i just re-watched ds9 in in its entirety and i was sitting
there like maybe i was really really sick like maybe five days ago crying at an episode of ds9
where it deals with race relations in the 1950s but there's also an episode in the in the last
season in the seventh season ds9 where it's where quark literally is trump he wants to make franganar
great again and that was made in 1998 i believe 1999 so you know trek's always done this stuff
but could you be a little bit more like not on the nose about it guys i i guess we'll have to
see time to visit rosa parks they did that dr who did they yeah there's a rosa parks episode yes
um yeah because like i'm not invested in star trek but as soon as that card show comes out i'm
going to be interested to see uh whatever one's reactions are just see see what they do
sorry have you watched all of star trek no i'm not invested in star trek i haven't seen
anything beyond like a handful of episodes here and there i think
yeah again my exact my my opinions exactly oh i'm not allowed to not have seen a thing
no no my opinion is is about this uh i think of what they're trying to do
oh well think of all the new fans they'll generate with the picard show
be great right because that works so well with everything else they've tried to do this with
well star wars is fan base is reinvigorated uh dr who's clearly game of thrones well game of thrones
doesn't have exactly i don't think anybody would say game of thrones ran an agenda did it it was
just terrible like there was no like i was clearly trying to push this because they destroyed what a
lot of people like the whole sleigh queen thing with with denarius that's out the window
when she killed children it was like oh can't really support people why still room for anakin
what are you gonna do what are you gonna do if you if you're you're a little you're a young girl
and you grow up with the name denarius or kalisi because kalisi was apparently the more common one
now your name is essentially either furor adolf or hitler
mom why did you call me that mustache well i mean some little girls can use that to their advantage
it'd be like oh you want to piss me off i'll stick my dragons on you just like king's landing
i mean dragons aren't real though that's the problem but i'm innocent i think everyone was
named kalisi is i'm assuming still a child i can imagine yeah i think that that trend started
about maybe like seven years ago when the show started to gain i'm but i think there's like the
last time i checked on it which has been a while it's like there's like five thousand six thousand
kids in the u.s named kalisi um someone sent me something just a moment ago there is about 1600
1700 people with the uh first name phasma really why okay oh it's phasma jones
it's a strange face name but all right not gonna judge phasma mcdonald
phasma phillips i like how if they go to change the name legally they're like
they go to us why do they check it they're like oh well it sounds like never mind no reason needed
like a duck dodger's name is like i'm phasma jackson like oh my god i mean you'd be pretty
yeah it sounds like a good pseudonym like you're a famous writer or old old uh some kind of some
kind of something i almost said jeff gordon i was a flash gordon it's a flash gordon right
you have um and now i'm thinking about the papa john's guy and i have no idea why
like flash is in a month brains man how do they work how many pizzas do i eat in a month
the the papa john said he ate 40 pizzas in a month
you don't know how big the pizzas would you don't know how big that sounds glorious
yeah i was gonna say yeah but papa john's is fine let's be real papa john's is pretty low on my tier
of pizza i'm gonna order yeah i don't i don't really eat much like i don't do delivery stuff
so i don't really know to rank them our family would get little caesars a bunch little caesars
five dollars for a big piece you go in there like yo i'd like a five dollar hot and ready
and they'd be like okay do you want cheese do you want uh supreme or do you want you know pepperoni
what happened to big caesars big caesars i refuse to call it anything but parvus caesaris
is that alien language again it's no it's just latin for little caesars
it's w it's no v and like the v sound all the true to caesar all way all the shit fucked it up
damn fucking bringing out the the the the the the the ancient lead speak only to get corrected
bigger um so yeah i suppose uh if there's nothing else we can we can talk about uh a few things
people are going to be expecting everyone wants us to cover the ralph video the ralph video there's
no i don't even need to be more specific than that but um uh rags and i am making it through
all of the films that joker ripped off um just checking them out getting a refresh and um one
down what two down one down two down we got yeah we got one to go two down two down and um and we
checked out parasite uh so yeah and i think i'm going to try and get to watch all of the uh the
films that are apparently deserving of oscars well before joker is just out of curiosity
but um uh like like someone on twitter said um sorry wait someone said phasma hut in the chat
and i'm like yeah let's order let's order something from phasma hut those those people
on twitter that would be like like joker as a screenplay is much worse than and then named a
bunch of movies and included in the list was uh parasite and endgame i don't know why someone
would think endgame screenplay is stronger than joker's no oh my goodness mauler somebody sent me
a message about helmet someone said the total number of clones in the star wars clone army
you know how many there were apparently this guy's saying he looked it up and to see how many clones
there were and he says there was one he says there's 1.7 billion clones were in the grand
army of the republic neat that's a lot that's a lot of clones probably not as many as all of
the troopers in palpatine's series of thousands of ships how many how many people were manning
the ships and palpatine's giant i don't i don't know if that gets into the billions like even the
supremacy only held like two and a half million people don't ask me where they came from well
how people does it take to man a superstar destroyer i don't know i guess let us go to
wikipedia that 1.7 that 1.7 billion is that like over the course of the entire time clones of
like existed i'm guessing let's see um i
it says it was in the efap podcast chat but i don't know that's just what i'm being told
that seems like a lot though watch those wrist rockets i mean considering that like okay i only
have star trek knowledge but like a galaxy class starship probably has a crew complement of like
1200 at a absolute minimum so and that's not something that can blow up a planet i mean it
kind of can but not necessarily so how much do those star disorders have let i it's got to be
like a thousand people i would imagine to man a ship that what a galaxy class which is the
enterprise um the enterprise d quite a lot from yeah quite a bunch yeah if you want to keep it
fully operational uh you know multiple ships and all that yeah i could believe it well let me look
i'm just assuming that's not like a current that was the number of active clones it was probably
clones across the entire clone war i'm guessing it says uh the enterprise about um it was capable
of carrying over 6 000 yeah but the crew had a usual complement of 1014 crew and civilians
okay so i guess the actual okay so the yeah the civilians see that's where i got that number from
in my head uh so probably in terms of a skeleton crew you could probably uh man a galaxy class
vessel with maybe like 500 people so let's let's go with like a minimum estimate i know the voyager
has the voyager which is a sovereign class vessel has 147 crew complement uh which is much smaller
than a galaxy class vessel so if we go with the absolute minimum of and this is me using star
trek to star wars you would need probably like 200 people on every single one of those superstar
destroyers where did all those clones come from and we we see them blot out the entire screen so
how would you get all those quotes from but whatever and they and then the supremacy holds
two and a half million people you wonder like what are they doing yeah when you have two and a half
million surely there's an actual like society aboard it like an actual economy a whole existence
there like there's probably factions even like they're split it's like oh the left side of the
fucking ship they sew up their own ass the right side of their stories about whoops i die on the
theme starship and all that sort of stuff yeah i would just imagine that that would be a fascinating
sort of look into the the world of the supremacy the the amount of people there like because the
way they portray it is it's just hallways with stormtroopers walking down them constantly yeah
it's just just hallways with yeah this stormtrooper hallways we they gotta go places not too quickly
though but they gotta you know ghost something over there they got let me look at how wide it
was again how many destroyers do you think were in that scene oh it was wasn't it like i feel like
it was like 15 destroyers individually on certain shots that's just the ones that we could see in
frame i know it's crazy i don't know why they did that they were like the first order is just insane
like it's the resources 61 kilometers wide that was after they'd lost the the super death star too
okay so with my calculator real quick if we have fifth let's say we see 15 star destroyers or just
with that and we give it like a minimum crew complement that's 3 000 stormtroopers or clones
right as an absolute minimum if i say that that the crew complement would probably be for a ship
that large of 200 oh my god i put rise of star wars final battle the rise of skywalker final battle
sorry this is i'm getting off topic but this is it's just so stupid well are you trying to
highlight that there was just a staggering amount of soldiers in in the first order's army and
they just don't give a fuck like the whole film doesn't seem to give a fuck
i mean how feeding 3 000 soldiers they fed them with the force
oh i guess you can you do that with the force no fucking no the team probably fed them so
powers right strange and unnatural or whatever transform my transfer my calories to you
using the force and i just imagine like she've like being like fed like with a feeding tube
just mass amounts of calories and transferring because when you look oh that's way more than 15
well no i was referring to tlj if you're talking about this movie then yeah it's over a thousand
as far as i'm aware it's like fucking bonkersville nick what the fuck right i i don't know if we
imagine a crew complement of 200 which is again is a pretty low estimate i would say for a ship
of that size there is a staggeringly low amount of tie fighters considering all of the uh the star
destroyers too but if we say it's there's 500 ships would that be a reasonable estimate i can't
believe that like if palpatine just put a put a couple of them above atmosphere just a couple
and um you know that might have worked out for the better because why keep them below atmosphere
what is the benefit of that if they come out of shields it's a very strange movie they also can't
figure out how to go up well palpatine can push them up we saw it in the beginning you can just
push them on up do it palpatine save your whole army you weird person like this strategy when i
googled rise of skywalker final battle to get pictures the second thing that pops up is star
wars what happened in the final battle in the rise of skywalker like fuck if i know man what the hell
happens how do you how did they write the up thing and in like the boardroom and not have people just
break out laughing they were like do you really think audiences are this stupid they're like i
think we could get away with it i think we can like you know what i think that i think that we
just i just just go for it guys we're gonna have a thousand star destroyers with a a thousand
death star lasers we'll have poe say it but poe will confirm this is totally normal
so i've got some bad news aden it looks like it is not a crew of 200 i have no idea that was
making a star trek estimate based on a galaxy class vessel which i think is small your estimate
it was a wee bit low it turns out that according to wikipedia uh the the crew is twenty nine
thousand five hundred and eighty five each star destroyer yeah this is the zyston do that that
even to me seems excessive but all right it is excessive but that's what it is it's got a crew
basically 30k let's give a conservative estimate and say there's 500 star destroyers
that's 14 million five hundred and forty two thousand five hundred people required to make
all dead you just picture like there's a there's a dude with like uh like you're like popcorn he's
like get your popcorn here just sell everybody like to keep them all alive because fucking
hell they need a lot of vending machines maybe they were just a special kind of stormtrooper
that just doesn't require nutrients in any way shape or form they're just self-sufficient
they don't even poop they're all robots this is this is why you it's why they had clones
and prequels and droids it's so much easier to explain than i don't know there's just loads of
people where'd they come from where did where did snoke get or snoke's palpatine you made it
crones where did she have get 14 million people he captured them from the planets
just i guess he just went around capturing kids well like there's a million of them red light
media sort of vaguely mentioned it's like oh did he conjure them just like jesus crack codge it like
he could have though like that's a thing now he could have actually in star wars can and it just
oh what are they okay yeah because like the writers they really like because we make jokes
about how the force is essentially used as a cop out it's like they really pushing it like
whenever you're stuck in terms of writing the force did it
it was like it used to be a big deal to make an army now it's just like they just pop up
everywhere there's probably a second republic hidden on the moon or whatever
um but yes uh we'll we'll we'll i don't know how that tangent even happened we'll cover the ralph
video uh in the future as we will cover season one of mandalorian that's planning on being done as
well um and an infinite crisis all coming out there's loads of just things that are going to
happen um also i was made aware that uh movie circle jick the subreddit that's a big fan of
of ephab and us specifically they are banning anybody who is uh associated in in positive ways
to um ephab they're just like strictly they're banning anyone yeah like just accounts that are
linked to the subreddit well just the mauler subreddit or just people who speak positively
about ephab they just get banned now oh my goodness you can't even speak positively vfap
so you got to stop doing that guys that's not nice they're trying to talk about how
much we're awful people and you keep ruining it so uh yeah um and and apparently the bad message
they give everybody is he won't fuck you um they don't know that for sure me and rags we uh
you know we'll decide that we have an open relationship so yeah very presumptuous of them
um don't don't take the message too seriously you know they they don't know they think they do but
they don't uh so yeah fun times on that subreddit as per usual but um with that i'm pretty much
good to go on this on this main event there is a link to the watch together we're gonna be
checking out um good old jebby nickels uh i i know that we're not allowed to um we've been told
several times by the world but this time will be okay because we have brought uh several women
with us so uh they act as um an artificial barrier of blockage if you will um but but yeah so the
interesting thing about this video this is a tlj video is that uh it's going to have aged rather
poorly um because of a lot of things to like about tlj let's say is is for a lot of tlj fans
has been have been changed by tros um that combined with the fact that uh we'll probably
see some arguments we're aware of but we'll happily respond to them and you know it's not
even that long of a video 23 minutes we can get through that in just under a few days right yeah
i think so excellent um i might say for episode 69 i i haven't discussed this with mauler
today i'm i'm identifying as a woman for today there you go so if you can use she her pro
sure pronouns i would enjoy that i would i would respect your pronouns that would validate my
existence whatever that means i don't know what it means but it already feels good
yeah and at that point like a ratio of four to one i'm just saying like
can you really say efap is a sexism anymore four to one all right is everyone ready for this
wondrous adventure so i'm already here oh my god i'm down jenny i wasn't ready
the top 10 worst reasons you hated the last jedi to be fair i watched like four minutes of this
yesterday and then i got bored so oh well then we're gonna have to try and make it entertaining
so i'm already hearing a lot of stuff about the last jedi the lighting is much better even
though this is in the past so i don't know hmm the light was better
i already said i liked it and i recorded that before people were making reviews
so i didn't know it was a hot take the time wait oh yeah i guess at your job it's fine
just i just i don't know who she could possibly be talking about
well people were split on tlj loads people came out super positive about it right like from what
i remember first yeah well those people like it was amazing loads people like didn't like it
yeah i think a lot of people they didn't they couldn't quite express why or what but yeah
like something ain't right here this wasn't the force awakens because i think if you had like
let's just pretend for a second that last jedi was perfect except it had the whole maneuver still
in it i think people will be able to easily identify their issue with the movie they'd be
like oh it's that one bit because that changed blah blah blah but when you have so many things
at once clashing like luke's character oh my god the concept of the force oh my god space battles
oh my god how much this the plot doesn't make sense we're chasing each other ah it's too much
i don't know what i think about this movie anymore the fucking the first shot ray takes
of the falcon and she gets a triple kill fucking triple kill four ships lined up perfectly in that
line and she just happened to be aiming at the other it's and fuck off you just hate women
oh and i almost kind of i almost miss shitting on teals yay yeah it's like a nostalgia trip here you
go oh it was a hot take at the time if i did i would have given it a clickbait title about how
it was a hot take anyway not everybody has to like every movie whatever but whoa i appreciate
doing people what was the the guy we covered like what feels like a year ago now when it was like
you have the right to like the last jedi you make sure we mention that in any of our response
videos as well it's in the constitution people i'm just glad she mentioned it whatever but
whenever i see people list the reasons they don't like it i tend to see the same things
popping up again and again and those reasons are bad isn't that kind of our um our position
with media analysis that we always get shat on for as in we're like you can like or dislike but
the reasons you have can be like proven you know accurate or inaccurate unlike people hate us for
that right i just don't think the reason she's going to tell well it's just interesting that
she's taking that position it's like oh that's hey that's our position woohoo we actually like
we agree with that yeah it's ironic right in that um i i she seems she seems to give that
impression that like yeah you can like or dislike it but your reasons are bad which is which does
seem to imply that you're allowed to dislike well it just sounds like she's saying you can actually
be wrong you can you can be wrong about your opinion on a movie which to me i'm like oh my
god like are you on our team what the fuck's going on here but obviously she's gonna she's
gonna take the complete opposite position but hey so i made a list number 10 snoke didn't end up
being anything i don't know snoke was like a clever misdirection we were supposed to think
clever about it there was nothing clever about it what here we go my my data because i read
a bunch of research on this and i actually have research on specifically star wars and
expectancy violation theory on why it doesn't work i don't know if i if i need if i should
like wait to blow my load on it because i'm gonna make a video about it as well but
clever misdirection is not what that was it was just stupid it was lazy nonsense what is it even
direct you to if right what's the misdirection who's the actual bad guy kylo i guess oh no wait
it's actually palpatine but we had no intention of doing that when we made this movie exactly it's
like it's like someone ushering you to like you know see the movie then they go that's a dead end
you're like okay so where is the movie then they're like okay i think the force awakens you show
that snoke is the person issuing the whole orders to the first order he's the leader of their
organization he calls the shots he's the one who created them essentially brought up their rise to
power he's like ha you just thought that he'd be important in some way you know like yeah we yes a
logical person with the brain yes we we would have that notion in our heads yes it wasn't clever that
ryan just decided lol no all right because kylo can't possibly do all that shit himself he just
he just turned to the dark side i'd like like a few years
his death by the way is not actually something that i definitively have an issue with because
like i think you could have he could have killed him in the second movie and i think he could have
done it well but it's just the well he had to die because people wouldn't have accepted anything
else i think um after he killed hon so that was gonna have to happen uh just via people's
expectations but the funny thing is that kylo would have had to have died um or or at least
have suffered the same or some kind of retribution for killing hon uh i don't think that people
would have accepted anything else and the research that i have on that is is consistent um in terms
of the snoke stuff uh all this oh it's just it's a just violating my our expectations we wanted a
big bad and oh it was a violation no guess what people don't like that psychologically they don't
like that it i have so much research on this at this point and i i've read it for a long time it's
not new stuff to me but it's it's just very silly to me that you would say oh it's it's a subversion
of expectations no it's not it's that you didn't know what the fuck you were doing that's what it
is well um she liked it so how do you explain that uh i mean people you're allowed to like
bad again we'll go back to that you're allowed to like something and it still be bad and it still
doesn't make any sense the fun and mental issue for me was just the snoke is the obvious connecting
piece between the original trilogy and the seagull trilogy he was everything we needed to understand
how the hell everything happened and he just gets killed and you're like oh uh why did okay and then
and then obviously you were expecting him to be important so it turns out he wasn't even though
he clearly is i was gonna say he's important whether or not he's dead he's still important
yeah he's yeah it's it's the the lore is very very very explicit that he is essential to these
events happening like if the emperor dies in episode six and everyone's like well it doesn't
matter he's not important like that's what the point of that scene is he's not important but
trying to say that anymore because he's not even dead but uh oh gotta love canon so it's a fun
concept i don't know snoke was like a clever misdirection we were supposed to think he was
our big generic villain guy and then he was dispatched so a crazed loose cannon could step
in and that's more exciting to me oh my god well well well where are we now i was gonna say i'm
sorry that's a days well did it yeah that is really great this delicious two-year-old glass
of milk is delicious like i got my last jedi pillow and my big fucking porg you guys didn't
like it to be fair i would like that big porg pillow just because it looks comfy just saying
i don't like porgs but it looks comfy no it might be it might be i could see it also being
pretty awkward to try and sort of rest on maybe when you're like reading a book you could sit
against it but sleeping on it i don't know if it would be hard to sort of get in a comfy position
it's important that we analyze that what was generic about snoke that he was big powerful
uneven monologue he wore golden clothes what a what a generic fatty he has a scarred face that's
generic yeah but kylo's not generic i mean in the sense that the writing is terrible for him and we
don't know what the fuck's going on and he's a crazy wild card character he just does whatever
i guess we don't we've never seen that i was gonna say like wouldn't isn't snoke your chance
to be non-generic to astound like i say that in my videos like snoke was this opportunity to be
like let's make a new villain in the star wars universe and what the fact that he's scarred
means he's like nah he's not gonna be interesting it's like okay yeah all right that's uh judging
people by their looks and that's terrible no one should ever do that right yeah jenny
um snoke was lame snoke wasn't lame well if snoke was lame make him unlame yeah why did you
make why did they make him lame then how come a lame person was the the head of this organization
you could do lightning and force control minds across galaxies or whatever like um is that lame
like he was a he was pretty much a blank slate as of force awakens there's a couple of things you
have to keep it which is that he likes to stick to the shadows which ryan johnson blew out he's
just like okay well here he is yeah but also why would that be possibly a good thing for your main
villain to be lame like i i mean even if it's established in the first film it would be like
uh oh it's a good thing that darth vader is lame if we look at the original trilogy
why would that in any way be a good thing well even seeing like darth maul is lame people thought
darth maul was cool even if i mean for all she's setting it up here that snow it is a good thing
that snoke was lame because that way we could have a non-lame character because it's good that he died
because it's lame right yeah i don't i don't see how you're like yeah snoke was lame but kylo
definitely not lame at all he is super cool and like for people being like you don't have enough
time to sort of improve him a lot of people saying thanos was lame right up until infinity
war because like we don't know anything about him he's crappy generic villain monologuing guy
probably and then you watch the film it's like oh shit they actually it's like yeah you could have
had snoke basically argue that um we cannot let the empire fail again because it leads the world
to chaos like you could just have him be that character like the guy in mandalorian exactly
yeah yeah the mandalorian guy just have him be invested in the idea that the empire is the best
thing for the universe not too hard much more interesting than i like power just like the emperor
did you're like okay there's the hilarious discontinuity between the mandalorian being
like the empire brings peace and stability whereas the empire as we see in the films just blows
everything up oh fucking hell yeah especially compared to the first order he's like we need to
re-establish the empire it's like oh they do and then they threaten to just blow up everything
after blowing up five planets fucking hell stop blowing things up jj six planets oh yeah kajimi
kajimi yeah they blew up which was really impactful by the way it's an episode you could really tell
that zori bliss and barbie frick cared about kajimi getting blown up oh yeah because the first
thing is they come in and he's like hey yeah you have fucking happy all those people are dead
and then you'd have to do a scene like in infinity war with thor you'd have to be
if you were trying to repair it it turns out barbie frick does that because he's hiding his
depression like he's constantly saying yay he's a really deep character yeah and then reaching off
screen to pick up a bottle and just down it's possible he starts to build an evil like army
of robots barbie frick does because he's so full of pain like how could the republic have ever
allowed this i'll make sure the republic never exists again and so boom you have the clone wars
again it's like poetry from chag what could have been should not be used as an argument against
what's in the text of the film come on mauler like what do you mean we're talking about tlj
is a hypothetical film right now she's making the claim that it's good the snoke was killed
because he was lame and it's like well ryan johnson made him lame he didn't have to
do no he really didn't you take anything you wanted i will say this about the research on
that that i read is that people actually really liked kylo after tlj they they because they
thought that he was the only character who had any personality and i think that when you have
nothing but characters that are personality less or characters that are are breaking
everything that you expect from them kyla was the only character from this movie who did have any
capacity because he didn't give anything to to poe or fin who were the other character or ray
obviously who had any capacity to have any character growth they didn't get anything
so the only character who had any growth was kylo ran and then that of course got just shit on so
and then well and it was it wasn't real it wasn't even real growth it was bullshit
the whole it not it was all hey hey he forgave himself oh he forgives himself over
if that's not growth i don't know what is he's like some guy who gets who feels bad about
masturbating and then she's like oh i feel bad about that and just immediately forgives himself
every time it's like it's been like a day you deserve it that way i remember looking forward
to the idea that we were going to watch a dark side training session between kylo and snoke and
it would give you loads of excuses to have them say a whole bunch of things will give us a whole
bunch of information about the characters we've seen that yet and the world not in the mainline
movies it's in uh it's in the shows from what i understand in either clone wars or rebels or
something but um yeah would be would be neat to hear from snoke why the dark side is actually like
the correct decision you know in the mainline movies there's those opportunities you have to
do all these different things but nope snoke was lame so killing him was the good decision it's like
oh why was he lame we made him that way oh um really before we go forward because i'm
going to be referencing the study a little bit it's a study sorry it's a study from bonus matthews
in wolf 2019 it's called the impact of moral expectancy violations on audiences parasocial
relationships with movie heroes and villains it's published just about three weeks ago in
communication research it is a study specifically on on the last jedi check it out it's a communication
research if you google communication research journal you will find the study i'm talking about
and then you can go to psi hub dot um tw and you can pull up the study no problem read it yourself
it's very interesting just want to make very clear what i'm talking about here because
people always ask me where i get my studies where i get my research check it out guys
the study found that like women don't hate star wars and stuff like that like it's very interesting
sorry they don't or should i say lame like in game of thrones with the red wedding i thought
the whole reason everybody thought that was clever is that it showed that a character you
thought was invincible because of established tropes they fulfilled could actually just be
unceremoniously killed off again the him getting killed isn't necessarily the problem like you
could still have him be killed in tlj i'm not that's not really where my issue lies exactly
him being killed gives us the impression like oh god we're not going to know anything else about
him now because he can't speak anymore like he's fucking dead um so you
